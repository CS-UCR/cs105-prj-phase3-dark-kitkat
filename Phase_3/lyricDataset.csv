All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call  another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it  but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night  oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off  I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town  where my past can't run me down
Another life  another call  another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it  but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm  another vice

Standing at the sink  not looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes  another vice
Ooh  another vice

My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it

Go and fix your make up  girl  it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better  gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs  dot your eyes

Two hearts in the dark

And you were the arrow
Straight through the heart
Broken apart
Beneath bone and marrow

We danced in the flames

Why do we destroy one another
If there was a time we understood each other?
You know I gave you all I could
It was never enough
You've broken this trust
And left me to rust

You belong to no where  as long as you roam free

Thought  ""Oh  good lord  she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself  so I walked up and said

We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up  let's go get this thing stuck""

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right  her and I  man  we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl  you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell  I can't get you out of my head

Lean back and watch the sundown fade

But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked  rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go

In the darkness on the edge of town

Waiting on a call from an angel

Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give em land with a good view to start a family

Take a turn on a bad road
Maybe go where the wind blows  baby

Man  I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures  not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine  man  I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes

Said that you was workin'  but you out here chasin' culo
And putas  chillin' poolside  livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide  find a nigga
Fuck him  suck his dick  you would've been pissed

Tell me where your mind is  drop a pin  what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune  but you lose me  you still gon' be misfortunate  nigga
Tell me  this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name  watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect  you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin'  you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place  the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you  but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt  we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else  I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick  nigga

Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck""  don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me  had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars  now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts  now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch  only thing fake is the boobs
Get money  go hard  you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money  go hard  damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me  went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it  I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras  y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches  went from WIC to lit  nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name  trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)

I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day  prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love  show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch  that's what it sounds like
Beast mode  that's how I give it up  nigga
Hoodie  low  that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt  woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money  bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy  bitches mad tight
Nails done  hair laid  keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot  headshot  tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga  I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that  oh  I'm too this
When you see what I've seen  you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label  ""Where the check at?"" (""Where the check?"")
Cardi B on the charts  ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet  they say I act wild (I act wild  wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child  skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once  tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B  know it's me  hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!)

Make up some other story
But if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it  try to bounce to it

Waiting for a change to come

No one else compared to you  no way
I always thought heroes stay close
Whenever troubled times arose

I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

Every single word you told me
I believed without a question  always
To save all of us  you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?


And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time  you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never wonder  work it out?


You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
There was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another

Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words  sing along

(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along

Which is standard for me  Thursday  12:30
I got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know  it just works for me
Anyway  I was leaving  I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But in its reflection  just for a second
I saw a figure  started to trigger
Memories flooded back  stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? It was my lover
A lover from a past life

From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

Well  somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal  poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down  closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to block out regret  but it was real
It just feels like a past life

From a past life
Crazy
From a past life
It takes a lot to trip me out
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on  but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean  I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I only wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life

For the first time

Don't have a room  but I'm not homeless
I'm filled with doubt  but I'm not hopeless
The stakes are up  but I got nothing at stake
Got a wounded heart  but it won't break
Never had much  grew up with nothing
But the music always meant something
I've been down and out
I've been on top of the world
The world it keeps on spinning on a turntable
On a turntable (x3)
Traveled the world  but been nowhere
All I do is worry  but I got no cares
And I drink too much  but still feel sober
This record plays over and over
Never had much  grew up with nothing
But the music always meant something
I've been down and out
I've been on top of the world
The world it keeps on spinning on a turntable
On a turntable(x3)
Keep on spinnin'

And when I miss you  it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby  you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world  I'ma need space
I'ma need space  I'ma  I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space  I'ma need space
I'ma need space  I'ma  I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me  but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me  but I'm tryna self-discover

You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight"

There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
Feels easier to just swim down
And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

If you see him in the street walking by himself
Talking to himself  have pity
You would like it uptown  it's quiet uptown
He is working through the unimaginable
His hair has gone grey  he passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city
You knock me out  I fall apart
Can you imagine?

Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you
But hear me out  that would be enough
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile
And that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
And that would be enough

If you see him in the street  walking by her side
Talking by her side  have pity
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown
He is trying to do the unimaginable
If you see him walking in the park  long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city
Look around  look around  look around
They are trying to do the unimaginable

There are moments that the words don't reach
There's a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we could never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Standing there side by side
She takes his hand
It's quiet uptown
Forgiveness  can you imagine?
Forgiveness  can you imagine?

If you see him in the street  walking by her side
Talking by her side  have pity
Look around  look around
They are going through the unimaginable"

So I decided just to play the part

And I feel proud of who I am now
Yeah  I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became

I was patient  but not anymore

Days and nights I thought I'd never make it at all
Couldn't make it at all

Unbreakable  like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe

I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am  once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it  can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up  deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together  but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe
No  I can't sleep

For hating you  I blame myself
Seeing you  it kills me now
No  I don't cry on the outside

Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck

And I said  ""play it again  play it again  play it again""

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM  FM  XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man  you should have seen her light up

Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up  up
Let’s kick the dust up"

You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in

Huntin'  fishin'  and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin'  fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning  late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke  mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on  climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

We get to huntin'  fishin' and lovin' every day

Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here  knee deep  in the Muckalee
Huntin'  fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

Huntin'  fishin'  and lovin' every day

Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different  but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats  fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight  and that was us
It might not have been you  but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya  I just gotta know

Me  I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight  and that was us
It might not have been you  but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

There are things that we can have  but can't keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers  flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker  quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders  pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen  one more chair than you need  oh
And you're angry  and you should be  it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it  doesn't mean it  isn't there

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers  flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?

Blood on the floor

I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I’m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender  no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together

Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive  you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done  hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

Goodbye  good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out  she in rare form
Wings up  now I'm airborne
King Push  they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup  where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear

But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

We say yeah  with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it  forget it  let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right  but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So  I'm picking up the pieces now  where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

You lost that right to hold that crown

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory  my memory  I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch  not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her  ""Hey  what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home  I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said  ""Nah  I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back  back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga  I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga  you know how it go
She deserved that  she a bird  it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt  let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga  you know how it go)

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas  probably in Tennessee—that says  fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me  you can't get fooled again

Fool me one time  shame on you
Fool me twice  can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times  fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper  let it rain on you
Fool me one time  shame on you
Fool me twice  can't put the blame on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script  the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret  could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

Anonymous flowers sent  you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov  took a power trip
Back home  I'm grown now  and the city's my throne now  huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out

Went and found a man  but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball  cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now  typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""

Let me take y'all back  man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

Man  it wasn't nothin' like that first time  she was in my math class
Long hair  brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me  used to laugh  had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin  straight crushin'  tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin'  man  what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it  if she sits on it  if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by  attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin'  thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad  and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said  ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  nooo
I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before "" knowin' I was frontin'
I said  ""I'm like a pro  baby "" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth  I knew that I'd get played out  son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that  so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh  you a pro  homie? Well  I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday  baby  we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby  you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher  please  don't make me stand up
I wrote back like  ""Yeah  baby  sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool  sound like the man
But I was scared to death  my nigga  my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit  knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  nooo
I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no

You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin'  ""God  don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos  tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go  right?
I'm in her crib  now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me  ooh girl  don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth  yeah  just how I practiced
But right before I put it in  she flinched and grabbed it
And said  ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro  but baby  be gentle  ‘cause—""

‘Cause I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no
And I ain't never did this before  no

And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin'  not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl  you a star  don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows  fingernails  hair
Is it real? If it's not  girl  you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch  that them broads can’t be
And that’s you  never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up  I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down  the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

Back round  crooked smile  we can style on 'em

But like the sun  know you know I find my way back round

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know  the movie stars  picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale  ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale  would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit  nigga  let’s make a mil
Hey officer man  we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell  let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now  and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy  hell nah

To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets  I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names  I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin'  the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance  I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty  my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it  you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag  this hard as it get
I do not snort powder  I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt  but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill  but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends  I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission  that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron  get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy  he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper  it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout  it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows  it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas  I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs  I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence  I mirrored your style
I studied the greats  I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me  you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo  still made all that noise
This year gon' be different  I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck  I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad  don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects  no fakin'  just honest
I wish that he had more guidance  for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas  Lord  we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters  the babies as well
We killing our brothers  they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image  we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail  nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck  I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

It's beauty in the struggle  ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block  man  we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale  no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me  Momma please  why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches  listen  this is what you'll find
The good news is  nigga  you came a long way
The bad news is  nigga  you went the wrong way

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick  do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks  turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose  I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere  but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

Can't talk without 'em  can't breathe without 'em

But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties  getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish  I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever

Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  nigga please

I see you nigga  this ain't no Rolex  it's a AP nigga
I'm hot  dog  catch up to me nigga—uh  couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like  ""Thanks for the view""  waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit  gave you the blueprint  don't forget

Going off  now niggas showing off

You tell me ya still love me  if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn  never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake  Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around  my nigga  white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin'  but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on  they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine  my aim too sick
I bang nigga  I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game  I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream  and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time  and claim 2-6
And fuck it  if the shoe fits  who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof  boom  paow  it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality  he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize  the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same  are the same  you and I
Different kind of skin  different set of eyes
Two different minds  but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"

Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body  I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer  all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story  can I get a glimpse?
Yeah  can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh  nice watch  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air
Hands in the air now  hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder  bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat  a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt  I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up  that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga  haunt you

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga  that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga  run that shit!)
Uh  nice watch  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air  run it
Hands in the air now  hands in the air
Hands in the air now  hands in the air

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command  my command  my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece  but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man  take me man  take me man
Your wish is my command  my command  my command"

Hey  niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block  serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded  they letting off
Full of adrenaline  ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back  family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now  the cops outside  it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat  her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges  back to the wall  I fight regardless
Screaming  ""Fuck the law "" my life is lawless
That's what you call it  ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard  snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes only

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this  unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still  my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me  maybe you miss me  maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles  maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not  I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner  'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance  I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once  my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up  drug-related  mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet  that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina "" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen  I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast  but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes  do you understand me?
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes only

It's several ways I could've went out  too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas  blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See  baby girl  I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street  let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry  he gon' eat your food
I was a fool  spent all my time ducking school  ducking cops
Ducking rules  hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner  if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box  where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes  for your eyes only
For your eyes  for your eyes only
For your eyes  do you understand?
For your eyes only

One day your daddy called me  told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately  he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains  still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling  he said:
""Jermaine  I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing  when times was hard
I never had discussions with you  begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood  you know my life
I know your momma  nigga  send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga  what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said  ""Listen  I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said  the only thing I'm proud to say  I was a father
Write my story down  and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record  for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one  another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World  barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later  making sure this story's told
Girl  your daddy was a real nigga  not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah  your daddy was a real nigga  not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed  ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only"

33 years  damn  I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker  we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money  pussy  parties  I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke  but they broke  umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man  they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do  who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me  I'm surprised
I ain't trippin'  listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man  let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice  never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See  I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind  that was just a segue
I must say  by your songs I'm unimpressed  hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus  you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab  they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down  fuck it  I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up  you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city  collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper  swimmin' in bitches  I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True  you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day  them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house  but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends  I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked  trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop  nigga"

Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this  the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South  ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king  right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well  maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away  I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana  laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh  this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait  I think police is at the door

Some things you can't escape:
Death  taxes  and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel  damn  it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news  in chains  damn

Don't follow me

Ayo  I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest  either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so  you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king  most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit  watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me  son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done

I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12  trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell  only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home  ""baby  don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader  fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect  I praise legends
But this what's next  the boy sick  can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet

I ain't grow up with my father  I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed  but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy  who am I? (Yeah)

Things change  rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better  dawg  I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along  nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square  kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low  sell a
Dime for a dub  them white boys ain't know no better
Besides  what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip  the appeal  too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home  she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello  and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked  ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on "" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me  ""Nigga  you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen  you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree  I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got  four brothers  one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama  dry your eyes  there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I  ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser  I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah  I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing  the illest nigga alive
Ayy  who am I?

Things change  rearrange and so do I
(Ayy  who am I?)
It ain't always for the better  dawg  I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along  nothing to see

I never felt better"

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean  gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain  wakin' up  cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin'  gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block  keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin'  know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope  all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga  that green
I'm a black king  black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat  too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga  put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga  they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world  but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone  or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn  death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch  ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas  ""sell dope  rap or go to NBA""
In that order  it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen  ripe with pain  listen..."

Seem like the whole city go against me

Man down  where you from  nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from  my nigga?
Where your grandma stay  huh  my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run  my nigga

Brace yourself  I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant  but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me  L Boog  and Yan Yan  YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly  wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh  Warriors and Conans  hope euphoria can slow dance
With society  the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day  I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine  Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine  we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door  fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up  you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump  pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's  AR's  ""Ayy  y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man  goddamn  all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94  fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty  just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies  IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley  make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes  except
When we in traffic and tragic happens  that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial  I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah  real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin'  nigga!)
Hood ('Sup  Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah  how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck  I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole  two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job  I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact  I got fired  'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up  gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin'  the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

G-yeah  cocaine  weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s  loc
Sherm sticks  butt-nakeds
Dip  make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra  Rosecrans  Bullis  it's Compton

I'm still in the hood  loc  yeah that's cool
Shit  the hood took me under  so I follow the rules
But yeah  that's like me  I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately  shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd  then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay  the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy  hearts turn brave
Mount up  regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip  yeah
Trip  we in the hood still
So  loc  grab a strap 'cause yeah  it's so real  yeah
Deal with the outcome  a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen  would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons  would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn  they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie  drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder  then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen  coward  the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit  a price on his head  the tithes
Probably go to the projects  I
Live inside the belly of the rough  Compton  USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

M.A.A.d city

You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?

Touch my daddy  touch my niece
Touch my nephew  touch my brother
You should chip a nigga  then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact  I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

Alright  kids  we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Hail Mary  Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder  sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street  your street  back streets
Wall Street  corporate offices
Banks  employees  and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest  or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin  I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in  you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops  accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice  then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles  then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists  et cetera  et cetera
America's reflections of me  that's what a mirror does

Broken promises  steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees

I can feel a new life  I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart

I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world  we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world  you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital  I know you had to
This shit is vital  I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain  tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable  give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves  you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

Man  I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch  put your hands up high
Hands up high  hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room  perfume  go  go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up  you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh  and I know your taste is
A little bit  hmm  high maintenance
Uh  everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice  poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean  I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy  there's blood in my pen
Better yet  where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that  pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party  she wanna go and party
Nigga  don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga  that ain't good game  homie  sorry
They say conversation rule a nation  I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real  P.S

You can get it  you can get it
And I know just  know just  know just

I really hope you play this  'cause ol' girl  you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in  it don't make sense
Young East African girl  you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game  put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it  maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice  poetic justice
You were so new to this life  but goddamn  you got adjusted
I mean  I write poems in these songs  dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress  ooh
Good God  what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations  I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real  P.S

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve  every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice  poetic justice

Would you trust it? I mean  you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb  it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb  it's you lookin' for it  maybe
Call me crazy  we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common  and what we have common is pain
I mean  you need to hear this  love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin'  sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference  it's coherent  I can hear it
Uh-huh  that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me  uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely  yours truly  and right before you go blind  P.S

You can get it  you can get it
You can get it  you can get it

But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin'  and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her  but this what I like  Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy  tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow  so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record  uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls  I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt  been down before
Nigga  when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like  ""Where do we go?""
Nigga  and we hate po-po

What you want you  a house⁠? You  a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano  a guitar?
Anything  see my name is Lucy  I'm your dog
Motherfucker  you can live at the mall
I can see the evil  I can tell it  I know it's illegal
I don't think about it  I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner  put the candy  paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket  ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it  be about it  every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it  Heaven  I can reach you
Pat Dawg  Pat Dawg  Pat Dawg  my dog  that's all

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright  and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence  sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power  full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"

It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie  you made me
Black don't crack  my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this  witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16  came to my senses
You never liked us anyway  fuck your friendship  I meant it
I'm African-American  I'm African
I'm black as the moon  heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy  my dick is big  my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people  your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm caught in my feelings  I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community  makin' a killin'
You made me a killer  emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry  the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry  the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry  the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry  the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave  cah' me black
Woi  we feel a whole heap of pain  cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains  cah' we black
Imagine now  big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip  left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start  cah' we black
Remember this  every race start from the block  jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this  witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean  it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me  penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up  fill up my tank  then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups  show you what these big wheels 'bout  ah
Black and successful  this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar  bitch  how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer  emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me  it's generational hatred
It's genocism  it's grimy  little justification
I'm African-American  I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no  fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets  I know you hate me  don't you?
You hate my people  I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously  he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus  only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon  chicken  and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind  I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will  that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back  whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child  I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it  wherever  whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop  I hope—

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well  it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck  suck and swallow
In the parking lot  Gonzales Park  I'm followed
By a married man  and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact  he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes  I run away and never do miss 'em
See  my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be  then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet  a leader  you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her  that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room  first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted  but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain  but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date  just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention  bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact  did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time  I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away  I'll never fade away  I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake  I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me  nigga
Don't ignore me  nigga  fuck your glory  nigga  you ain't shit...

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today  I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper  ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon  and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about  ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right  your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means  wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life  I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money  drugs and 4-5's
I count lives  all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry  pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights  even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down  my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Tired of runnin'  tired of huntin'
My own kind  but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin'  the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel  who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner  look at the coroner
Daughter is dead  mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets  AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently  but they couldn't
Bring her back  who got the footage?
Channel 9  cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip  split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre  that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin'  I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch  die with a coward
Hope we get rich  hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song  a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst  dye your thirst  dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot  fire is proven
To burn for eternity  return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin'  choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit  we lie about comin'
Now back to business  loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick  your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin'  it's no discussion
Hereditary  all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst  dyin' of thirst

Too many sins  I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted  granted  if he provoke
My best days  I stress days
(Lord  forgive me for all my sins  for I not know—)
My best days  I stress days
Say ""fuck the world "" my sex slave
Money  pussy  and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is  know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin'  tired of runnin'  tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin'  tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See  a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free  so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst  you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water  and pray that it works.""

Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin'  I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother  homie!
Young man  come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See  you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water  holy water
You need to be baptized  with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay  repeat after me:
""Lord God  I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God  I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""

Is this mic on? (Hey  move this way  this way)
Hey  Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up  c'mon  c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody  nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls  come up here
(One two  one two  what's happening  fool?)
Come right here  this is for you  come on up
Kendrick Lamar  make some noise  brother
I done been through a whole lot
Trial  tribulation  but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me  tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh  I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God  boy  don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time

They wanna say it's a war outside  bomb in the street
Gun in the hood  mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme  uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces  post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down  wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me  tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh  I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front  ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you  come on

(Crazy  what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving  (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police  I wear my heart
On my sleeve  let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence  everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this  nigga

(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me  tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh  I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God  boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)

Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down  down valley deep) Huh (Down  down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one  two  three

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon  don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night  night  night  night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin'  I can never see the message
I could never take the lead  I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building  lay my body...

(Offstage Argument)
Not on my  not while I'm up here
Not on my time  kill the music  not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit  this for the kids bro
2015  niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu  how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan  how many we done lost?
No for real  answer the que—  how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—  this year alone
Exactly  so we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time  you know that  the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left  dog
On the dead homies  Charlie P  you know that bro
You know that
It’s mando  right  it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac— enough said  enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on  because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check  mic check  mic check  mic check  mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen  listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said  ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous  sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well  this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor  king  ruler  now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S  say it with me  or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey  tell her she right on time

Man  I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up  then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today

And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are  you are  a loner  loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger  stronger
I'm in the house party  trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen

In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)

Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep  her president is black  she black too
Purple label on her back  but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head

""Beg your pardon?"" ""Oh  I rap  baby.""
""How old are you?""  She say 22  I say 23
""Okay  then we are crack babies.""
""Damn  why you say that?"" She said  ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later  just tell your neighbors and the police relax.""
I stood up  shut the blind  closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said  ""Read between the lines.""
Yep  hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me  then looked at it
Then she grabbed it  then she said  ""Get it understood.""
""You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s  that A.D.H.D crazy.""

Now

When I was 27  I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money  is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment  and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27  my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money  had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin'  get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear  guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old  my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself  my family  my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear  fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear  fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear  fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear  fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear  fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear  fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear  whatever it is  both is distinctive
Fear  what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me  so hopefully  they disperse
Within fourteen tracks  carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear  what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me  so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks  carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you  God damn me
God damn us  God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says  ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth  therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way  we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks  Hispanics  and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites  according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities  for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son  so the Lord  thy God  chasten thee
So  just like you chasten your own son  He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you  so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws  statutes  and commandments
And do what the Lord says  these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here  in today  in the United States of America
I love you  family  and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America  the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand  join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin  isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger  but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes  to ashes

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder

Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

When I lay in bed  I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn  you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn  you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

Don't stop the party (making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty  yeah (making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you  tomorrow when I run into you

You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him  I think of him

I can't believe I'm telling you this  but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

Tomorrow when I run into you  tomorrow when I run into you

We were in the swimming pool
I was naked  boy  so were you
And we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
And now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
I can't believe I'm telling you this  but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!"

I would've said what I wanted to

If I knew  it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two

Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger

Won't even let the sunlight in
No  I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou
Oh

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby  that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning  and turning  and turning
And I'm not movin' on

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No  I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment  ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss

Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger

I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever  but I can be

So I just packed my baggage  and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own

Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

""Baby  why do we love each other?""
I said  ""Honey  it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

Thought that I would be alone forever  but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home  but I think with you  I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets

Do you ever think about when you weren’t so grey
When everything you did wasn’t a mistake

You Make me feel important
Almost like I'm someone else
Self loathing and self pity
Thanks for extending your help
You never made things easy
Taught me love is never enough
Showed me all I have is my bad luck
Subdued  I am broken at the thought of you
You're not the person that I fucking thought I knew
Motionless I've become undone
Overwhelmed by self disgust
Crippling form  forced to adjust
Vacancy still acts as my crutch x2
My doubt was all that bloomed
Fear was all that moved
And this pain Inside my chest
Reminds me what I've been through x2
Stuck in a rut
I'm existing in the in between
Forever empty  splitting at the seams
Misery  gave into you like nicotine
You're the devil in my bloodstream  the one thing I could never leave
Exhaustion fills the hole you left
These senseless sentiments I've tried hard to forget
I'm so fucking worn out the devil always wins
These demons on my back keep pulling me in"

We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

Give me a time and place  I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it  I'll beat you there
Girl  you know I got you
Us  trust  a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit  now the sky's our point of view
Man  we stepping out  like woah  oh God
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me ""What's my best side?""
I stand back and point at you  you  you
The one that I argue with  feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side  it's green where you water it
So I know  we got issues baby  true  true  true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

Sugar on your lips  it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill  so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth  trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you  am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything  anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Losin' it  I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame

Don't do it to me  no  no

I know you don't wanna talk  right

You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf  right?
When I touch you  I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold  so cold  so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno  Yoko Ono
Oh no  round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson  I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh  you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up

I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never  I will fight
I will fight 'til forever  to make it right
Whenever you knock me down  I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up  pick it up  pick it up  pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never

Never say it  never never say it

I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

Cause there's just no turning back (oh no)

J Smith and JB  uh huh
I gotcha lil bro  I can handle them
Hold up  aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me  taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill  they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended  was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force  if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th  ice water for blood  let's go
I gotta be the best  and yes  we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath  I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars  so the moon's where I land  I'm gone

I will never say never  I will fight
I will fight 'til forever  to make it right

Pick it up  pick it up  pick it up  pick it up up up

I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed  but got too much bread
To make  she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way-way  boy that's McLaren

Where you used to come and get me with the swerve  swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing  nothing
Nothin'  nothin'  without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs  tell 'em to call me at 911...


I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal  you need to go somewhere  like  get some bitches or something
I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga

Lonely  lonely  lonely  lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume  but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker  public speaker
Oh my God  that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist  he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know  is that I wanna
Win so bad  but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low  it's real low  it's so low
You can't lift me up  I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark  I guess that you could call me charbroiled  huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari  call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren  bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love  do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it  I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy  what have I done?
I got the talent  the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror  mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball  fetch
I never had a pet  that's where it stems from  I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Popping since Bastard  (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers  my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle  but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup  and a couple of them swallowed

So  a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught  it's off  I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo  too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick  motherfucker  sue me

Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons  naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter

Watch me get this money  nigga; tired of being hungry  nigga
Nothing funny  sass me while I'm thrashing  I'ma punch you  nigga
Never made of plastic  I'm a savage -- you look lunch  my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss  my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies  bitch
I'm hocking  spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices  Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash  attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck  so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying  please
My pockets solid  making profit off the highest tees
Bitch  merch twerk as I get on the verse  cursing
Nigga Dom so cool  I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money  I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions  fuck rehearsing

You niggas gon' give me mine  'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time  getting money  any grind

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr  never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater  but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one  tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid  I run where the fun did  my nuts itched
I was defiant  always said  ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones  now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too  til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap  nigga  I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers  and well
I tried to tell the kids  like fuck it  start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See  they don't have an identity  so they needed some help  but
Really  boy? Posers looking silly  boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit  older than Tity Boi
Not a diss  but same with ice cream  my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith  Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women  and spit wrong  like he hates dentists
God damn menace  666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing  he hates women  but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping  man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil  hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money  I said  ""Hi "" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles  huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival  huh?
But then again  I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick  and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh  they never played it  I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me  bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but  shit  who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't  they turning on me  shit  they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time  I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link  bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober  I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma  I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump  you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular  jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off  like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up  and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol  I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck

Well  Tyler  hi  I'm Dr. TC and um  I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um  it's gonna be three sessions: today  tomorrow  and the next day
So  just tell me something about yourself...
Well  look  if  if you don't talk  I mean  these sessions are going to go slower

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death  go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead  well I don't know  we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor  this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun  nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother  none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls  I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not  fuck them

I'm tall  dark  skinny  my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school  coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon  but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo  bitch  how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma  she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house  she always tend to start shit
No to drugs  I never spark it  I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father  like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming  demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught  go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said  somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me  but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind  big moves  Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble  my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal  play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch  don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother  my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister  just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me  I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious  you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven  what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem  the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad  I'm a toss it  eat that shit up  Rick Ross it
Shit it out  bag it up  sell it  I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless  protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare  my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck  so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy  I wanna hug  oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to  soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk  drink it

Whoa  umm  it seems you had a lot to say
Uh  who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter  the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name  but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking  if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen  still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me  you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy  hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies  I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus  I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal  I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing  whatever look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion begin
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the policeman (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like (""I don't know"")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced  nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times  (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door  (Man  I'm so paranoid)
Fuck  'cause

'Cause girl you're perfect  but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone  I never pick up
And girl  you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush  I just might be in love

A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy  joy  joy  joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing

This is more than a crush  I just might be in love

When you're 35  I'll be 41  and when I'm 27  you'll be 21
Yo  this is dumb  and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run  'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you  shit  I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T  they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention ""hang "" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation  shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span  it's gonna suck if shit  hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off  not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like  but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest  that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word  you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings  fuck

(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls  I never pick up
And girl  you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young
Part 2 - PERFECT

Boy I know  that we could be more
Than just friends  but you're scared
Boy I know  that we could be more
Than just friends  but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared  scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock  I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow  this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby  it's just you and me

But you're too fuckin' young

I live life with no fear  except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green  I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did  guarantee she'd be gone  well
I got a plan  'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand  I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize  got weight on my chest
That I need to get off  or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up  'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names  I wanna be your number one

I'm in my right mind  keep it on a high

You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me  someone to talk to  uh  it's been a while since our last session. So  tell me what's been going on

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris  I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year  it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument  shit  I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket  so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens  pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro  how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

""Tyler  you'll top it  you'll top that  you're a very capable individual""
""Okay  you guys caught me  I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer  I lied""
""You know  you just want attention  you'll be fine""
""I try too hard  huh?""
""No  you don't""

Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink  so fuck a wine set
Nigga  fuck a mindset  my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head  I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh  that's a triple three six  isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make ""Parade"" or ""Inglorious""
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft  I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick  I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth  I know they full of flavor

""Can't they just be happy for me like  a kid with nothing  living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?""
""I think everyone's happy  everyone's immature  everyone loves you Tyler  you have to believe that.""
""I don't even skate anymore  I'm too fucking busy  I can barely kickflip now.""
""Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?""
""What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?""
""I have  I mean you're a great person.""
""I mean  I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole  I'm pretty cool  right?""

People excited  thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that  (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet  but they want to critique
Everything that we  Wolf Gang  has ever released
But they don't get it  (They don't  it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping  it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird  you're just a faggot  shame on him

""It is  but Tyler  you're going to have to cut down on that ""faggot"" word  that's very  that's a bad...
""I'm not homophobic.""
""I mean  I don't think you are but...""
""Faggot.""
""Alright  well  since the last time we...""
""The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.""
""I mean  you  you  it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts  just.. I mean  they're really random and it's ADD.""
""Who doesn't have ADD..? Well  I don't.""
""I mean  sometimes  you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know  what's the problem for this?""
""I wish Thebe was here.""

Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see  that's my decision  you fuckers don't have to listen
Here  put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids  I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men—I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great  so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went  I wasn't learning shit (I mean  you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean  you've explained to me that you were in school  but  I mean  I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager  who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good  so that date is postponed for now
Wow  life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons  nigga  throw 'em at pedestrians
(So  what are you saying  take advantage?
I mean  you've been doing pretty good  I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life  but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone  just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside  sometimes I just want to die (No  you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em

They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is  since a youth kid  thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; ""poof "" gone
But  it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose  how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like  ""Eh""
Barely interested  but bagged just to brag to my boys like  ""Bruh""
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder  tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn  I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter"

Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit  I don't remember
(Two  three  go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest  you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two  three  go)

Whether it's rain or shine  I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone  my love's gone
My love's gone  oh  gone
(Two  three  go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone  my love's gone
My love's gone  gone

Gone  gone  gone  gone  gone

I know love is  is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

Whether it's rain or shine  I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone  my love's gone
My love's gone  oh  gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone  my love's gone

You kept me goin'  the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin'  the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone  gone  gone)
Going  and now I'm scarred for life

My love is gone (Gone)  my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone)  my love is gone

Ayo  it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion  feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock  knock  knock  knock
I'm not shocked  I brought this on me
It's my fault  you gon' leave
Lesson taught  see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees  and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing  I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets  nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing  I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints  but understood influence
You opened up early on  I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit  never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth  I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace  so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

I hate wasted potential  that shit crushes your spirit
It really does  it crushes your soul


Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind  mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

I said go  go

Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin'  poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in  we take all of your shit
And when you wake up  she help you try to find it  I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her  ""Get him "" she say  ""I got you""
I say  ""No  bitch  I said get him""
And they so pretty  and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word  we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up  she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple  I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads  what's that you say?
Watch your mouth  Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked  you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel  I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business  she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you  she lie through her teeth cavities  fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone  tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile  the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed  we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses  and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say  ""What's wrong?"" He say  ""Nothin'  keep restin'""
She say  ""What's missin'?""  ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head  she say  ""Get back in bed""
And she gave him some head
Boy  you can't trust them bitches  and then she say—ooh

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin'  poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line  stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes  ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa  long hair  don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em  ""Ooh  daddy  let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah  then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love  she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets  he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say  ""Good girl  just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute  I say  ""Girl  you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside  watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked  she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in  they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off  put a gun to his frown
Nigga  turn around  I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around  caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is  put your fuckin' hands up
Liz  that's enough  you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy  she about to be a bastard  oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me  nigga
But think for me  nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me  nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy  nigga

She slip somethin' in it  now faint for me  nigga

And now you're lookin' down a barrel though  nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose  nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole  nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though  nigga (Uh)

Ah  every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker  on the floor  fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock  Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture  uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute  he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man  he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough  it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it  man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks  jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind  I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked  he was unhappy
Bitch  I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet  I wanna break up  don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard  acting
Fucking on another nigga  that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick  that's just nasty
Matter of fact  bitch  gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch  gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me  let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? 
Touchin' yourself  lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet  watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you  I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers  the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what  I give up  let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit  you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this  I guess
So in conclusion  since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

She say  ooh  Daddy  ooh  Mona Lisa  Mona Lisa
Ooh  fake smile  Mona Lisa  Mona Lisa

You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied

You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Uh  I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne  I'm lookin' at the..

You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn  I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up  that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile  that's a blessing
I see the change  I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again

You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars  man)
You told me that they can

Talking to each other again? (Uh)

I tell her  ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!""
I already know that life is deep  but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous  but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder  the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well  just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge  I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh  she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me  ""Baby  it's real.""
And I say  ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby  you know the deal
And she bad  so maybe she won't  ugh
But shit  then again  maybe she will  yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Yeah

I tell her  ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me  but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I  give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick  not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say  ""Choose wisely "" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt  it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now  I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh  she just started to pop it for a nigga

You dig?
Mack  I'm going in

A millionaire  I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease  like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil  and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit  ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds  minutes  hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister  brother  son  daughter  father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge  pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him  you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em  then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em  then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em  then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker  I'm ill

I open the Lamborghini  hopin' them crackers see me

Okay  you're a goon  but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin'  nothin'  you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want  bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private  damn  I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah  I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more  she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah  nigga  that's my bitch  so when she ask
For the money when you through  don't be surprised  bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker  I'm ill  not sick
And I'm okay  but my watch sick  yeah  my drop sick
Yeah  my Glock sick  and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker  I'm ill

See  they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G.  Jay  and 2Pac

Who that one that do that  boy?

And I be the shit  now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels

And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers

And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker  I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe  look like it's poutin'

Won't lie  I fuckin' love you  whoa!

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me  how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No  a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one  it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate  ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry  so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves  no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young  blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry  stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry (Don't cry  don't cry)  don’t go (Why  oh why?)
Won't lie  I fuckin' love you  whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry  don't cry  don't cry)
Don't go (Why  oh why  oh why  oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry  don't cry)
I fuckin' love you  whoa! (Don't cry  don't cry)

Talent is God-given  be grateful
Fame is not a given  be humble
And conceit is self-driven  drive carefully
Stay in your own lane  seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns  rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like  ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark  now the sun back
Hit me hard  but I punched back
The wheels fell off  I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself  ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears  let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry (Don't cry  don't cry)
Don't go (Why  oh why  oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry)  I fuckin' love you  whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife  rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry  don't cry)
Don't go (Why  oh why  oh why?)
Won't lie  I fuckin' love you  whoa! (Don't cry)

Don't cry  stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise"

Hate in my heart  love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain  days are the same
You keep the sunshine  save me the rain
I search but never find  hurt but never cry
I work and forever try  but I'm cursed  so never mind
And it's worse  but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in  no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on  motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong  motherfucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch  I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now  rebirth  motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth  motherfucker
I'm gone  motherfucker  I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent  and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak  and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive  murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch  I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now  rebirth  motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth  motherfucker
I'm gone  motherfucker  I'm gone

It hurts  but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

Man  it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in  up it's time to raise it  then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin'  boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame  that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear  one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God  won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words  so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me  that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently  bitch  it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg  yeah  prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up  this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable  Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin  dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives  I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch  I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now  rebirth  motherfucker

For a second you were here  now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love  never had a love

When you was just a young’un  your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up  so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself  so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Like you never had a love  never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault  wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me  be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby  so don’t be mad  nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

Mary Jane invades my brain now I can't complain
I'm sayin what else is there to do besides relax
Let the problems in yor mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got yo trippin you watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants
As the words become a sentence you start to feel indifferent
The stress is out your mind you feel like the weight was lifted
Terrific  I'm glad we had this time to discuss
I'm outro  call me if you want to blaze one up

 When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
 I let the music take over my soul  body and mind
 To kick back  relax one time  and you will find
 When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
 Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind
 And kick back  relax one time  and you will find

I try to keep it stress free take every day at a time
Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind
I got plans to take charge like major outlets
Ride around the country chillin in my LA express
On every street corner
The importance of having fun
Empty bottles filled with tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin
Under the blue sky  the state laced in smog
Pollute your quarter inch cables with all the sound that we brought
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game lampin' with his son
Chuck D yo word up we buggin over time
From the light to the lime original star time
It's the Double Chris One
And Camel brought the ammo so we can shoot
Game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the do-rag replace it with a thinkin cap
If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that
We here for one thing and that's to remain
What's the name...name...name...nigga

When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
I let the music take over my soul  body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you will find

Yo  L.A.  hit me one time  make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin lucky
For this jackpot I jacks pot to fill in my crates
We lay back chillin and feelin the music relates
We on the to the two hangin with my crew
Bullshittin while we sittin down drinking on some brew
And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickel sacks freestylin all night
Doin it right knowing with time music make it better
My crew banging two blocks like shots from my Berretta
Snub nose to the hoes who pose I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin you so by the time I get to Phoenix
Underground ground heads will fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests so God bless crooks
Who steal loops to keep this shit alive
Something for your troops to sit around and vibe by
From Camel  Double  and Thes  to ease stress
We brought the hip hop so have fun and God bless

When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
I let the music take over my soul  body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you will find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you gon' find

Y'all from San Francisco right?
Nah G we show alot of love
For the state of California from Humboldt to Oceanside ya dig
But L.A. is where it all happens for the Dub and Thes One
All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

Who wanna test?
We lickin' off shots in the west
We make believers out the best
Lay the weak to rest
In southern Californ' now ain't no place like this
Half the stuff y'all doin' we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and you runnin your lip
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to Tritia Toyota on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Ah  sucka niggas with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillin with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen  you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future there's some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now a field is where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
There's phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if they ain't a snitch or a bullin'  they're claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights  all day  all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we rule?
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

Got beef what a pity

Every rapper in the house  shut the funk up

Now about five years after they kill Creeper
The hot Wrestling move was the sleeper
Drug dealers rock beepers
T tops  jerry curls  jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The COLORS soundtrack rocked the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are emery sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Chano's and La Barca  not Taco Bell
And if you're not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin L.A with something to say and something to prove in
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowd's groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks jock New York rap on a block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)
L.A. is the place where I solve my problems
In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here
Cause when I'm in L.A. my family's there

In your nugget it’s the rugged book report slanger
I’m a banger  the kind you keep in your disc changer
The best five for your greenbacks we make em ease back
Push that album release back and re-think
While I remax in one of them hot air joints
Floatin over the city like the Goodyear pimp
Fuckin' up your ballgame with my fame you’re lame
The frequencies get tweaked capacities get pushed
To the limit tell em I did it just to stay up in it
I play to win at all costs and I stay in the way of danger
To bein’ real I’m a relative  never been a stranger
So when you see me walk by nigga speak up
I’m a fan of hip-hop since EU and Da Butt was in
And my nigga Doug Fresh ran the show
Three Times was Dope and MTV was yo
But now they’re slow and guaranteed to show
Some extra’d out rap niggas braggin big about figures
Never spit about an Escalade if you ain’t rollin
Don’t spit about no weapons if you know you ain’t holdin

Serious it’s steady bill  bringin the raw deal
Straight from the west compound bringing you the break down

Thes One representin Lima Peru
Mi barrio suco my Los Angeles crew
For unity heads that I met chillin in 92
Here’s another album we found em go pound em with the new
Lyrical blue light night special the waterloo
World-travelin have a new Fat Larry-style crew
Havin to move place to place with a smile face
Cookin down the vinyl to finally make bass
Something for sophisticated 8th-grade hip hop taste
For heads that remember the breakup of 3rd Bass
Tribe  EPMD  Pete Rock and C.L Smooth
Hear immense influence that congruent in my groove
It’s a tribute  a syllophantic  god damnit
That my loops and breaks I excavate second-handed
I’m just bein me and doin my best with what I’m blessed with
Influence of the west that frontier fresh shit
The sunset jetset where kids catch wreck
It’s no thing to see my on Venice bumping Reign of the Tec
And fellow shit  my mellow pick em up in Crescent Heights
We dip to the hype club and rock it all night Gs
The people under the limelight are like you
Drama with our ladies and can’t afford a Mercedes
But been in it to win it since the 80s so play these

We trying to get enough  we gotta fill up
Before it's all gone the song remains on
Until the beat stops  nevermind  no need to remind
You know who we be  yo it's the capital G's
Putting the P's in hip hop  saying hi to the ho's
Who wear hardly any clothes  here's looking at you
Watching you  watching me the incredible MC
Chicks call me Mikey (why's that?) cause I like it
They stare when I'm digging it and know they wanna try it
They like the way I rap  they like the way I chill
Couple hours in a conversation show them how I thrill
I'm a one minute man I lick it then split it
Empty it out fill it in like the blank and I'm out
Big Mike that's right give them something they can feel
Yo I'm the top-ranked chief on the wheels of steel
I walk the streets of L.A. and feel comfortable
Me and the homie make music and they come in with bullets
So next time you got a rhyme that's blazing hot  throw it away
People under to save the day

Sometimes it ain't timed  sometimes it can't be

The music is playing loud and we never have to leave
We never gotta leave  we never gotta leave

Beautiful brown skin lady  you move something  Montego Bay-style
Smile from the Caribbean isle  no fronting while we pumping the beat
Audio files to jumpig like Guile out of their seat
With the complete vibe  scooters and 45's to palm trees
Red-stripped nights the calm breeze the type to relax
Ease back to conceive wax and contact the origin of habitat
Two cats making it fat  it's like that
With a rap similar to a pitter-patter of a cat
Walking a roof to make it back to the truth
(I dig crates) for the late-great existence of black plates
To booming the eighths on the floor  making you want more
Leaving my mark like a dark mark on a wood floor
It's good for the soul like dinner with your moms
People Under the Stairs the duo who drop bombs
Snares laid back like armchairs at the beach
I'm outta reach  so play my CD and let it teach
The recipe: half B. Crocker  half David T. Walker
Fresh breath control like Binaca

Sometimes it ain't timed  sometimes it can't be
This time we kick back and let your conscious be free

So I call up my homes (yeah man  what chu' say?)

So pick up some ice and bring the chronic through
The homegirls down the street went to the swap meet
To get some more chicks they’ll be back at three
So we break out the bones and get to slappin’ em down
We got doo wah diddy pumping surround sound
It’s a lovely day and I feel like Bill Withers
Food stacked on the plate  mad lunch and dinner
The neighborhoods chilled as the sun goes down
Niggas getting tipsy and begin to clown
But we all just laughin’  eatin’  coolin’
Givin’ high fives talking ‘bout the old schoolin’
Sending B.G’s to the store for blunts
I dedicate this song to the first of the month
We might wake up and try to do it again

You bring the links and I bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the wings and I bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the ladies and I bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue

At my crib I got three barbecues
One I keep upstairs for daily use
But downstairs pumping out eighty thousand BPU’s
Don’t get it confused I bring the beef to you
(ay ay homie don’t touch my grill) Got it under control
Flip meat like I flip beats cooked with soul
Only use the best ingredients available
That’s my word  they're cooking turds over Kings burch?
Charcoal but ain't goin' out like that
Tortilla’s and corn and we can all get fat
And if you want another plate  get you some more
Hey  the dog’ll eat whatever meat falls on the floor
Empty handing you jack's back to the store  hit the shelf
And don’t bring back beer your gonna drink yourself
Now putting Laser in the cooler  making the switch
Then I see you drinking my Coopers  son of a bitch
That’s the ol' one-two but homie it’s all good
It’s an L.A. thang and that’s understood
It’s the same ol’ barbecue  but man it’s all good
It’s just an L.A. thang and that’s understood so-

Trying to diss and get that ass knocked out

Thes born in South America  moved to South Bay

My DJ’s got fame  underground Rick Dees
I am MC  so bring in funk in five minutes
I jam like the 110 in the ‘84 Olympics
Keep the rhyme moving like the Unity location
Rap has been my vocation
Since before the Japanese owned the radio station
That’s why they Fired Jay Thomas
I keep it fattened like the llama  yo  I promise
Never stop  never change  like the price at Dodger Stadium
I blow up  rock free shows at the Palladium
Afterwards  the crew I’m taking ‘em to Tommy’s Burgers
Gotta be for every Los Angelino Murder
A rhyme for every burglar  Thes a well-worder
It comes together in a freeway like East LA merger
That means you’ll get no pay  but I urge you
Keep ya eye on L.A. like Chuck Henry  word
You heard of someone better? Send ‘em our way
He get done the L.A. Way  the drive-by way…
 ‘Cause I’m rough and I’m tough…
In a b-boy stance… and I come from L.A. (all scratched together)

Check it… everyone in my town think they got flows
Thes serve more wack MCs than waitresses at Roscoe’s
You know me  at the graveyard shift  gettin spliffed
We can take it downtown like Figueroa and 5th
And after that  I’m heading up to El Cholo for some dinner
Bustin’ through the inner-city underground like the red line
Thinner than the line at car wash in El Niño
That’s you son  see no time in this locale
Underground  down  talking ‘bout  “Yo  I’m keepin it real!”
I’m coming with the Walkman and tapes  not steel
Not a .22  .45  but a 9  Double O  6
Put it on your letter to the better  lick a stamp  send it
And mail a letter to Thes  L.A. legend like Fernando Valenzuela
Yes  he never ran in a battle  yes
He be smoking beedis  watching the sun set from Sunset

Ay-yo  we got rappers walking around  shook like earthquakes
Blame it on San Andreas  it was a fault you had to wait
To grab the steel  how you feel? Ain’t even got skills to represent
The City of Angels  my whole team is heaven sent
Getting shit accomplished  yo  check the way we rock this
Like the Raiders in ‘88  fool  you can’t stop us
Like gang-banging  this shit’ll be banging for centuries
Imperial groups spreading like bank robberies
Over the Southland  we put the funk in your trunk
To bump hard  like 808s  sorry you had to wait
But we was digging in the crates  no fear  it’s here
Shady like MacArthur Park  don’t get caught after dark
Might never come back  see  sometimes it’s like that
Some niggas carry a gat  some niggas use their head
But the smartest of the smartest’ll still come out dead
It’s true it ain’t where you’re from  it’s where you’re at
But you’ll still get caught up wearing the wrong colored-hat
And on that note  everybody shut the fuck up and kick it
Spliffted  whatever you do  make sure you don’t miss it
‘Cause we coming like the end  yo  it’s just about wax
So watch out  we bringing bad luck like Wilshire and Fairfax
And it’s just like that  so check it out…
 ‘Cause I’m rough and I’m tough…
In a b-boy stance… and I come from L.A. (all scratched together)
 “Fred  where you from?”
 “L.A.”
 “Uh oh  uh oh! Uh oh! Ask him where he started from…”

 Double K
Man  sitting alone's crazy  sometimes amazing
Physical on the couch  but mentally  yo  I'm grazing in the grass
Staring through the glass filled with time
Just hanging in the air  but it really ain't there
My rhyme was dope  a couple seconds ago
Couldn't even peep my own flows
Sometimes thats how it goes
Don't even catch myself when I'm wandering 'round the Badlands
Being the bad man  looking for a lid in hand
You probably think I'm bugging when I say that I'm the president
And all these other dudes are hesitant
I got the answer to everything  it's all in how the door swings
Your way or that way out there  I'm right there
Purple hills and purple pills are for people who probably
Never permanently tried to get live  you lied
Pre-paid hip-hop taking over the two jeep
But this marijuana I'm smoking  steady  take heed
And every time I blow  she tell me something she knows
A very good listener  we rap back-to-back
And rat-pack shorties is always telling a story
They too busy watching Glory and Belly
Wishing for a celly with the flip-down talk switch  just to pop shit
But this group I came with  we on some rock 'n' roll shit
Psychadelic paragraphs  I might be thinking too fast
Answers in the form of a
My brother  don't ask
Half the time I don't know  it make sense and then it don't
I grab ahold and let go 'cause it's all for show
And when the curtains come down  I'm still giving a pound
With the same frown as Mike T with the pro sound
And the know-how  I think I go now and wonder how
That bottle that looked full was really empty
 Thes One
We got forty bottles of water empty up on the wall
Spinning around like an R&B singer under a waterfall
Releasing the souls trapped inside  neglected record
Translating to rap  capped loop to five
The second to sequence the frequencies with ease
Moving through the cosmos  remembering the breeze
With the sound of the whispering leaves in an endless forest
Where lives are won and lost beneath every tree
Stand in it  the infinite expansive mind dance
And catch an overnight flight to France to water the plants
I travel to a beach where each and every wave
Sounds like an Ultimate Breaks and Beats
And the streets are paved with slip mats
Sitting in cafés with hip cats in cantinas in Lima
Drinking a six-pack  then get back to my life where I'm at
Turning on my porch light  cleaning off my welcome mat
So stop by sometime  we'll drop a rhyme or two
And sit up on the porch and drink a cold brew
Watching the sunset as it moves through the haze
We can melt into the music of Los Angeles daze
The sun raised the morning of praise  the warning of ways changing
I'll probably see you there and won't…
Letting my mind zone  touching you in your own home
Transglobal like Mobil or a corporate affair
To the dome; peace  split home pieced
The parental release slip is signed
I rhyme while I field trip"

Far away from Los Angeles  not worried 'bout no guns

Living the wildlife one coast to another

Young handsome brotha on the disco hype
Got the butterfly collar and the skins to match
Ten crates in the booth  got a break to catch
Skills needed to apply  dress chic and be denied
Pay the cover and fly  everybody’s gettin high
Please don’t ask why  see the ladies get tipped

Oh  party people  let’s set it off tonight

See  I was born and raised in the ghetto
Ate the Aunt Jemima and Nabisco
They say I do my thing at the disco
And keep the groove real slick like Crisco
Ceremonial conductor of the rhythm  one time
Peep: my hands move fast under lights that shine
All the girls know me  and all the fellas act jealous
So G  Reggie Wells  without the sales and tales
Get the folks overzealous  what they tell us? ( Oh  yeah!)

Why don't we give love a chance?

Yo let the brotha rap for a minute
(All right) Let me get in it
Got some things I want to speak about
The topics gonna creep about
Hey P  a young man around 20
Really he ain't ballin'  basically ain't got no money
There's nobody on his side cause his love is the 1's and 2's
Back and forth all night  makin' it right
Now everybody in his cypher got something to say
Ayo you need to quit scratching man that shit won't pay
And Pops kicked him out  put his tables on the street
Just cause he wasn't down with the ITT
But he knew they'd catch the vapors  one day or another
So he dropped his boy a breeze to take it down to his brother
Now he coolin' with his brother but he buggin' 'bout the papes
Ain't trynna hit the little club on Wednesdays  and mixtapes
That junk ain't payin' no bills  who you tryin' to fool?
So once again his jockey Joe Blow is on the move
And now he's house to house  sleeping on the floor
With his jacket as a blanket  said he thinking bout before
All he needed was his peeps to sit and watch him succeed
Nobody blows up overnight  and every one of us need
Some kind of push of support  without that  he sorta slipped
Get to drinkin' and flippin'  not thinkin' and always wishin'
Yo I got a solution  it's called Show me some love
We all guilty of not doin' it  you can hear it above
 x2
We should take the time
Just sit back  rewind  unbind your mind from the grind
Why don't we give love a chance

See what the world needs now is love  hope and support
Greed gottem bleedin'  teacher making money for sport
And cash role models fall by little kids that love them swizz beats
Shit  when I was young I watched Sesame Street
To all you young B-boys keep doing your thing
Don't let them tell you otherwise cause you ain't makin' no green
'merican cash machine keeps rollin' with or without
We got a subculture to save  and I'll be damned if I shout
Some shit over tracks that's wack to make a fat stack of cheese
Hip hop is my art  only myself I can please

It doesn't matter what you wanna be  focus and move ahead
Make sure you do it for yourself and not off what some other said
Cause when you go that way  it ain't from the heart
What we do is what we been doing from the start
Ain't makin' music for executives sitting behind the desk
I tell them fools to eat a dick and bring it live to they chest
Cause this is art that you created  you get paid with respect
A little patience and pride  and with that you pose a threat
Take a heed  young brotha  to the words I speak
Unless you wanna see your promos lying there in the street
Cause money is man-made and any time it can be gone
Just kick back  spark one up and peek the words to this song


When push comes to shove I rise above  sort of
Keep my eyes  mind focused on the goal that is love
So when fans give it I rip it  return it  earn respect
See I'm in it for that  and not a fat paycheck
On that  Cino you can quote Thes  cause I said it's true
Money doesn't equal happiness  no matter who smiles and piles checks
While I'm on the steps drinking Beck's with my friends
Piece and our forties cause we don't got ends
Memories like that to me are Los Angeles palm trees
Life landmarks telling me the CD's at ease
Friends are worth Gs  enemies can sit in pawn shops
I'mma worry about the riff and when the sunset stops
Listen the simple pleasures and measures are always greater (what)
Double K rippin' fat back apart our crossfaders
Little girls laughin' and waitin' for ice cream trucks
These images I wouldn't trade for a million bucks
So when chasin' the gold gets rough and says life sucks
Remember the lining's silver and that's always good enough
So when chasin' your gold gets rough and you lose steam
Count your blessings my peoples  don't be so mean"

There’s no better way to start your day then this
Checking out the supreme two  recover the blitz
That was once in hip-hop  but lately  this shit’s cheap
Every man sound like another look-a-like in the street
And that’s bad  that ain’t nothing to brag and boast about
Get on TV  fake the funk  and show out
Ay-yo  that’s high school shit  niggas need to present
Something like this  hanging with the purpose of kicks
Back hands and fly rhymes  and Thes with the loops
Something lovely for the troop  in a jeep or a coupe
‘Cause its universe-atile  you know the way it was
When everybody enjoy the body rock in the clubs
But  yo  nowadays  it’s either this or it’s that
I rather diss real quick with a baseball bat
The hat stays to the back  and the sack steady burned
The way cool West rocker with stripes to earn
Not the tape you claim  that ain’t the game I play
In the cut  I lay twats and study day-to-day
The masters of the cere- taking care of the crowd
I get cheers when I’m moving  if- yo  if not  they’re booing
It don’t matter  I still do it  strike harder than first
Put everything I been thinking into one long verse
Without a curse  without the bullshit  running it down
The way I do it kinda spooks  spread it over your town
For these Starbuck-niggas running up to the mic
They don’t excite  they bite  going against the rules
Like it’s nothing  but it’s day is coming
And one time  me and Thes’ll be  like  here… laughing and shit…
 Cold tearing shit up
Damn People Under The Stairs
Cold Tearing Shit Up

Yo  I roughly rearrange  connect text through context  to set a frame
(Double K:] Alright…) I allow my lyrical campaign through vocal grain
With well-trained thoughts  I spot stains in the fabric of time
With the magic of mind  I fabricate rhyme connections
Then harvest pop culture with old record collections
With soul in our ears  we hear loops they can’t
And free the lost rhythms of indigenous chants
We hip-hop enhanced like banging on lunch tables
Ransacking Radio Shack for RCA cables
Hats with your name sown on at the Swap
Yo  it’s all in our blood  pulled out through red drops
Until we stop  we claim a separation that always has been
Since when Hard Bop broke from Cool Jazz
From the West and manifest the style like Hampton Hawes
As yet  Thes rap-like Gods and show flaws on others
I went from pause loop tapes to twenty-four crates
Discovered: history repeats  so I looped beats
Collect loot on the streets  keep the people out of their seats
At shows with the long-handed flows of polysyllabic prose
And No-Doze  administered no sleep
Yo  we come from the Sunset  and that packs heat
You see  the style is westerly  like the winds of change
You see  this style packs heat like things cooked on a range
You see  this range is cultural spare change that’s forgot
Thes-One’ll keep the art form hot…
 Dedicated… to… every forgotten crew
Dedicated… to… all those Los Angeles crews
Dedicated… to… all the DJs… still doing it from back in the day
Dedicated to South Bronx… Look where we at now  y’all…
Dedicated…
To L.A. (repeated on double delay)
 To find out where you fit in  call your recreation office and get behind the act. Just for the fun of it! Who knows? Inside you  there may be a masterpiece!

It seems I have evolved in to this party animal

Get off the mic and let me babble 'bout the days of old

All I knew was colors..and that stuff my mom made

Bro go easy on the ice and add a little more Smirnoff

Take off my shirt  show my belly  offend a few of my friends
And you can ask Kid Lex we be doing the most
On Melrose with a 5th in hand  yelling at hoes
And ain't getting no play from the ladies who pass
Shit  we're drunk  breath stinking without a inch of class
And that's alright with me  'cause baby I'm the Big Mac
{Went over to McDonald's}  I'm 'bout to cop a fat sack
'Cause niggas be like ""Every time I see you K  you drunk.""
Remarks like that will get 'em judged as a punk
You ain't Crunk  buddy I'll take your latest hip-hop money
Divide it wit' my friends so we can all get funny
Keep your thoughts to yourself 'cause on the real cousin'  I'm buzzing
Tell your peoples I'm a motherfucker case they thought I wasn't
Mom said: ""Chill out..or watch your life go down""
Saw what happened to a friend  well it won't happen again
And I promise: most functional  this bottle here's my petrol
Force field for the unreal...I got no time to kill
Plus..the first time I took a nip I didn't sip
Couple of wine coolers took exactly what it was
What a buzz! Had the young Double stone-knocked-out
Like a sucker who stepped and posed a threat when I went
You can call me what you want: A damn drunk or a fool
But I'm the first to pass out and make the shit look cool
Incidents like that are few like the brew Zima or Tequiza
That's for women somebody pass the gin and Powerade
Yo it's also time to drink..get off the track

Instead of a rub-a-dub  it's a different kind of rub
The kind of rub that expresses love (Yeah)
And she's sure to dig it!
Hah! Hah!
Ay-yo  Thes One  kick it!
 
Put your hand on your heart  put your hand on your heart
Peace  peace
Palm  palm

 We partying… we partying…
 Yo… yo… what’s up with you  fool? Haaaaa. This fool Thes One. Ay-yo  what’s up  Thes?

I walk in  talking to friendly faces in my aces
Drinking beer  smoking beedis in the back where the bass is
The place is packed  doubly stacked with ladies of nice asses
The only ice rocked is in glasses (alright)
I move on  the DJ rocks a new song
People flooding the dance floor  just to get their groove on
To that old funky and tough  the speaker bump buff
JB horns blowing  they throw in some black stuff
And the crowd goes nuts like a disco dream
Seat reserved for Thes  candlelit  table is clean
The brown wicker chair  looking like Al Green
Sitting back  legs crossed  straight checking out the scene
( Oh no!)
Crowd looking and slinging to Eddie Bo
While I’m walking to the bar ‘cause my drink’s getting low
I need a Long Island Iced Tea  double  no ice
Something fruity for these two cuties ‘cause they look nice
They giggle and they whisper  her friend called me Mister
Thes One of the P  she’s getting geeked  so I kissed her on the cheek
Double stepped in ( Yeah  what’s up  y’all?)
I see these pretty dudes eyeballing from the wall and I stepped back
( Man.) This is a family party! We don’t act ill
So I’mma tell these young punks that they gots to chill

Woah  they say the bigger the headache  the bigger the pill
People Under The Staircase dropped  ya feel?
I’m smelling like dope and I’m shooting for more
Eyes glued to the nookie moving slow on the floor
I say she hella sexy and her friends were markable
Conversation was rolled up… yeah  sparkable
But wait  here come my nigga from the big bad Heights
Said he had to stash the yee so it won’t be no fights
See  real niggas do it right ‘cause we partying  y’all
Don’t need no flowers on the wall  I need a glass that’s tall
Full of the “Strong” Island to get the KK wiling
I spot Thes One with some freaks and they smiling
I slide to the bar  being the coolest  ya dig?
Tell my man  “The usual  plus a shot for the kid”
He did his bartender thizzle  got my order in a jif
He spotted suckas looking cool like they wanna get with me
But  man…

 I ain’t dosed with these dudes  you know what I’m saying?
 They don’t understand…
 They don’t even know… you know?
 But… check it out  ladies
 All the girls… tuh…
 Uh huh…
 So they can see where we…
 Alright  dog…

Yo… see  this is my house  and I know everybody here
We all bubbly like the beginning of the year on the eve
Turn that shit off  I ride rougher than that  my pride’s tougher than that
My niggas kicking raps in the corner  I jump in  like
“Hop hop hippy” to the “you don’t quit”  Double Mike is legit
I get pounds from my friends  I do the Flavor Flav and I jet
Then get my whistle wet  but  oops  I couldn’t forget
Yo  remember that light-skinned  big Freak of the Week
Walked up  feeling like one of the members of Chic
I said  “Baby  I’m full of ‘Good Times’  let me touch your ‘(Funny) Bone’
Is it cool if we go home together?”… “Whatever ” she smiled
Yo  I could tell she was playful like a child
I grabbed her hand  said “C’mon  it’s time to party down!”
You know?
 I know you wanna party down right?
 Hey! What’s up  Mike?
 Hey  is that your friend over there? You tell her to come on over here and get with the program  okay?

 Digging in the crate
 All the time
 Digging in the crate
 Right on! (x2)

We got forty crates  black plates  rare grooves  breaks
No 78’s  Vietnam era United States
American funk  private label on major turntables
Sunken treasures that’s in the 4/4 measures
Now life’s only pleasures is digging  I do it often
So when I die  don’t cry  put my records in a coffin
And bury me next to a very big tree with my MPC
So they won’t warp  as a corpse  remember me
As a daily beat digger that figured out better ways
Of tracking down vinyl  like working at Rhino in the good old days
When the pay came  raised the notch  new spots
Friends with owners  under counters  digging through the new box
45 shoebox to understock rock  records before gas
Wood and glass  fuck it  I’ll walk for weeks
And sacrifice heats  looking for beats that coalesce
With chronic  like this here 45 on Microtronics
New spots  harmonic to sonic  enhance my life
My records are my children  my ancestors  and my wife
They’re there for me  carefully picked and never bit
My record karma stays stronger than the record by the Biz
I known places you don’t  did places you won’t
Yo  fuck a loop-digger in my city  man  just stay home
You see me by a pay phone on Normandie and King
Don’t wonder why as you drive by  I’m doing one thing
Head down  studying my music like Schroeder
Daily digging dust missions wearing out my motor
Fingers full of warts  back aching  arch support failing
Two hours to a new spot  fuck it  we still bailing
In my ride  digging worldwide  bringing heritage home
Reconnaissance  innosense  Renaissance elements
Evidence of long lost musical intelligence  big-picture relevance
 Digging in the crate (scratched and repeated)
 The only way my life makes sense
I’m two weeks late paying my rent
I’m digging out the past and the present
And now my fucking money’s being spent
The only way my life makes sense
I’m two weeks late paying my rent
I’m digging out the past and the present
The only way my life makes sense
 (Check it out…)
I get my records insured before the life coverage
Up in my room all day  y’all say I’m on some other shit
Digging through the blue  grey  yellow  and green crates
Like I’ve never done it before  got records scattered on the floor
Got records hanging on the wall and in my bathroom  too
Got stacks up in the hallway  let me put this another way
Yo  I don’t give a record dealer nothing but cold cash
And a hard time  pats on my back  ‘cause now I’m doing fine
Vinyl is like food  fool  I need it to live
My fingertips been touching wax since I was a small kid
And ever since I been a big Double  it’s kinda bad
I sit and just listen to all the money that I had
I drop ten on some smoke  you know where the rest goes
More money to listen to  never dressing for the hoes
Fuck clothes  DVD  or holiday and real estate  relationships and bullshit
Ay-yo  I’m digging through the ( Crates)
 Digging for shit… then I’m going back
(repeated and scratched)
( Ha! Hey  Thes  we cooling out right here  boy… yeah… ?… hey  alright  aw  fuck it  man  I’ve seen it all  it don’t matter  man  it ain’t worth it  it’s all good… aw  what’s that right there? Ha ha! That’s why I’m going digging  man! ? no more…

 You remember in Cali when I grabbed one of your… we threw ‘em up  yo  we was in Hollywood  right? We’s in Hollywood  I grabbed him up  you took his gold  he ain’t do nothing  we still got the gold to this day
 We taxed the kid!
 Yo  man  I ain’t never been…
 We taxed him…
 We gonna tax him again
 And again
 So just keep your mouth closed
 I ain’t never been taxed before"

For ya too man
I told ya boy  he said he was comin' down there man just

Don't be sittin' around  lookin' like you a clown man
Get on down here and party down
Shit  see ya later man

This old man  tryn' to party  shit man I'm tryn' to go chill man
Get my smoke on  make it a couple weeks man  not dealin' with shit
You know what I'm sayin' man? I don't even feel like partyin' man
It's just last time I partied man  motha fuckers throwin' up
Motha fuckers fightin' and shit DJ was whack
Damn bout to party by myself man. Just sit back here and chill out
Smoke a little dope
Maybe I'll just chill out (???) and let him see what's
Goin on a lil later  you know? What?
I'mma take out the trash in a minute man  leave me alone

I live an analog lifestyle  sometimes it's wild
I wake up to see the sun to hear my thoughts start to pile up
Man it's rough bein' a young cool man
Don't want to hear nobody tryn' to tell me what they thinkin' and
Thinkin' and shammin'  thinkin' that they jammin' and not
It's a hot day  so I proceed to go my way
Out of contact  turn up the beats and start to zone out
The phones ringin'  I knock the phone out
I'm bout to thrown (???) out  I need a little ism for my Friday
Hit my nigga up  told him I'm on my way
But before I got where I was goin'  pages started flowin'
This freak from around the way  the bitch was mind blowin'
But no time for her  I'm on some cool out shit
Coped my bag  hit the pad  sit back and watch the loops flip
I'm in the middle of a head nod when all the sudden
The power went off  soon as I hit the kick button
Now  Double K ain't afraid of no ghost and I know
I ain't trippin' on this Bombay smoke
I'm about to post and keep blowin' until my mind is shut
But yo that was real weak right there

It's been on of those weeks  stressed infrequently
Scrougin' up money  payin' rent in DWP
My girl mood swingin'  actin' funny  didn't test her
Left for the studio but broke a compressor
Rock the show on Tuesday  promoter didn't pay me
Said y'all never work again  and this here city of L.A
So the middle finger I flip and then my jeans rip
I order jumbo jack but they gave me fish and chips
That was last night and now I'm like ready to drink
Forget the dirty laundry and the dishes in the sink
Cuz the party life is like nuthin' else and if ya got a lotta problems
Put your shit on the shelf and let yaself go  I felt no
Worries as I slid out south to Crescent Heights where the Double stay
Hit out on the block and I arrive
Walk in  jive talkin'  slappin' the five
It's time for the party life

Yeah  you know I'm bout to go out tonight  me and Chris
Yeah Chris that I rap with  yeah that guy
Yeah we gon  we gon go down to this club tonight and probably hang out
I be home a little later on. Yeah  yeah I fed the dogs
Yeah  yeah I cleaned up. Yeah I quit. Ok. Yeah I'll be back
Yeah we partyin' tonight  we partyin' alright  I'll see you later

What up Double? Yo that's a dope beat
Man I heard there was a spot  poppin' off down the street
We could crash and smash a free long island iced tea
Heard the bartender is a fan of the P

Haaa  sounds like a mother  my brother
Let me get my smashes  wait til my t-shirts clean
We can ride up the block  time choice with big hat (???)
Steady sippin' here mumblin'  man what's that

I think I hit a little somethin' just to wet my whistle
Don't touch the silver bullet  I'm drinkin' the miller missile
And I reminisce a little bout the days of old
When I used to drink it all down or so I'm told
But whatever I start the car  raise the break lever
Never swerve  pull up to the club  we hit the curb

Damn man  what the fuck you doin' man?
Shit drinkin' and drivin' boy
You know how we do it man  lets go
Go on in there and cool out you know
Yeah  you got your wallet? You saw the Lakers yesterday right?

Cause everything I say one day will be one way
Or another recovered in it's original place
Signify this straight caligrified verse
Petrified rock  put your goddamn block in a herse

Only thing worse  Kaos bursts the eardrums  the P
Making the beats and rhymes funkally-dunkally
Fat like Chunky A  but not out for radio play
Here's a crew washing the wax my mind space
Type A  not negative  no way
Plans for three sixty five days
I add a fourth cause I leap year
I leave tracks like Amtrak
Battles the P and Superman
After that your crew will try and forget like a story
It's the Amistad  man you bet there's no one better
I rip it all up like a letter for the principal


Kaos bursts...(Double K cuts in)

Them brothers from another mother  shit

Hip-Hoppin in its rarest  punk
You know you wanna admit it
All these crews runnin around with wack tracks
They don't get it  they gettin' me stressed (word?)
The gettin' me mad

So what you sayin  Double K?

Just put that shit on my tab
Don't feel like dealin' with it now
I'll deal with it later

Yo  so I should cater
To the niggas who been frontin' since we first stepped in
Brought it back a couple of times
Now you give it a grin
First you tell your homey
""Yeah man  that shit's fresh!""
Didn't know this type of shit could even lurk in the West
We puttin' hair on your chest
We flow with no hesitation
Late radio stations ain't allowed on these premesis
Niggas is hearin' this
Late at night like domestic violece
Smackin' you the fuck up
Until we get some silence (word)
The P be like Judge Judy on the mic
Puttin' up a fight
Rollin' hard 'till the break of daylight

Tribute

Long time ago  me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden  there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said
""Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul"" (Soul)
Well  me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
""Okay""
And we played the first thing
That came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes
And it's easy to see
One and one make two
Two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say
The beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us
""Snort
Be you angels?""
And we said
""Nay
We are but men!""
Rock
Ahhh  ahhh  ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh  whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is not
The greatest song in the world  no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember
The greatest song in the world  no  no
This is a tribute  oh

It was the greatest song in the world

Ooh  guh-goo-bee
Ooh-guh-guh-bee-guh-guh-bee
Fli-goo gee-goo
A-fliguh woo-wa mama Lucifer!

And the peculiar thing is this my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song!

This is just a tribute
You've got to believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ah  fuck!
Good God
Gotta love it
So surprised to find you can't stop it now

In a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family
Religious through and through
But yea  there was a black sheep
And he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B
And he refused to step in line
A vision he did see
Of fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam
And all the planets did align

Oh  the dragon's balls were blazing
As I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fucking cockles
With a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon
Fuckali  sing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me
Then I shall fuck you too

Got to get it on in the party zone
I gots to shoot a load in the party zone
Got to lick a toad in the party zone
Got to suck a chode in the party zone

You've disobeyed my orders  son
Why were you ever born
Your brother's ten times better than you
Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us
Comes from the depths of Hell
Rock and Roll's the Devil's work
He wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet
Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction
And chaos it will bring

You better shut your mouth
You better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week
With no telephone
Don't let me hear you cry
Don't let me hear you moan
You got to praise the Lord
When you're in my home

Dio  can you hear me?
I am lost and so alone
I'm asking for your guidance
Won't you come down from your throne?
I need a tight compadre
Who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil
But man  he can suck a cock
Rock is not the Devil's work
It's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am
Stuck here with my Dad

I hear you  brave young Jables
You are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method
Sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches
And this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go
To find the land of Hollywood

In the City of Fallen Angels
Where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance
And the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune
Through the Valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons
Now go  my son  and Rock

So he bailed from fucking Kickapoo
With hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide
To find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew
That he would find his counterpart

Tangled up in a blue
Rambling cut my front tooth

Not a shining golden airplane
Gifted full of booze

Reaches high enough for you

And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry  the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh  then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block  brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry  dry your eyes  never let up
Forgive  but don't forget  girl  keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin'  don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you  you should leave him
‘Cause  sister  you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up  I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women  be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up  ladies  but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo  I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough  we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends  but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know  it's funny  when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive  ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up  huh  you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up  ooh  child
Things'll get brighter

And uh  to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact  I'm sure
And if you fall  stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man  feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside  but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did  you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world  I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy  it seems it'll never let up
But please  you got to keep ya head up"

Pull the trigger  kill a nigga  he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids  who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""

Give 'em guns  step back  watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back "" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark  now Huey's dead

We gotta start makin' changes

How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?

One better place  let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people  they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real  time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret  don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me  what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way

""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey  but that's the way it is

That's just the way it is  aww yeah
That's just the way it is

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts  givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up  back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this  when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool  my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black  I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat "" that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is  aww yeah

Pass the Hennessy  I hear you callin'  can I get some more?
Hell  'til I reach Hell  I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom  I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it  what can I do?
One life to live  but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison  sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin'  life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights  I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary  nigga!

Come with me!
Hail Mary  nigga  run quick  see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La  da-da  da  da  da-da  da
Come with me!
Hail Mary  nigga  run quick  see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La  da-da  da  da  da-da  da

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now  walk around half-dead
Head down  K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in  now I'm twisted  blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live  and I multiply  survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy  smoked out  feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker  nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back  sixty seconds 'til the draw  that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first  you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love  now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work  and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke  I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up  there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas  get your pay and weight up

If it's on  then it's on  we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase  can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate  hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on  then it's on  we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase  can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate  hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary  nigga  run quick  see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride  ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary  hail Mary
We won't worry  everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry  everything will curry
Yes  we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary  hail Mary!

When I was young  me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old  kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school  and scared to go home  I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister  over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies  the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused  it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary  hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police  that's right
Mama catch me  put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend  Mama
You always was a black queen  Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare  tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back  but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady  don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady  place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady  don't you know we love ya?

Now  ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy  ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry  ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless  but all along
I was lookin' for a father  he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own  so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty  ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone  because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen  tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough  you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back  but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady  don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady  place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady  don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret  always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night  there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day  gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back  but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady  don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady  place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady  don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady  lady (Dear Mama)

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex

The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin'  lookin' like I robbed Liberace

Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot  not rally  to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks  not Ballys (yeah  that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits  and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide  let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside  so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say  but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town  the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now  you know how we do it  like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly  money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind  nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged  addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it "" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier  must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated  only what you make it to be
Uh  and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny  go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear  ""Go to the telly  ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause  bitch  I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed  feelin' Crucial
From player to player  the game's tight  the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches  'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission  want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though  clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts  no glory  my nigga  bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me  Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems  then handle it  motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh  yeah  and now you got me right beside ya  hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride  I was the first off this side  give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me  but I'm hard to kill
So open fire  I see you kill me  witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries  envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me  watch me bleed
Mama  come rescue me  I'm suicidal  thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time  better day  sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life  and if you right  then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try  at least you tried for it
When it's time to die  to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police  my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it  I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics  equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block  evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear  been away for years
Now I'm back  my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish  didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards  that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated  incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary  musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail  niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest  a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya  my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya  hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday  time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise  how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam  got some smokers on  whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan  livin' life flawless
Crime boss  contraband  let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve  I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks

It ain't right: parasites  triggers  and fleas crawlin'
Sucker  duck and get busted  no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business  nigga  keep on coastin'
Where you goin'  I been there  came back as lonely  homie
Steady flowin' against the grain  niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit  this crap shit
It ain't funny  niggas don't even know how to act  shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?

All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like  ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me  y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin  ""Damn  he did this  he did this ""
Just be like  ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say  y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty  nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin...

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but  by keepin its dreams
It  learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared

The rose that grew from concrete

Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary  we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well  we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why  thank God nigga  ask me how!

And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace  young nigga  there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas  we the last ones left  but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace  young nigga  there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas  we the last ones left  but life goes on

Life goes on  homie
Gone on  'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you  nigga  trust me  I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year  nigga  life goes on  we're gonna clock now
Get money  evade bitches  evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you  baby
Next time you see your niggas  we gon' be on top  nigga
You gon' be like  ""Goddamn  them niggas came up!""
That's right  baby  life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey  Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there  man  don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more  hold me no more
Yes it do  yes it do  yes it do"

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh  light that up  Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit  you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha  ha  ha  ha  y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us  a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect  I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision  my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P  Dogg  my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough  I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom  waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time  it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down  the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion  I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game  but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage  they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey  she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel  and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you  baby-bubba
You see  this is for the G's and the keys  motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest  two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years  so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it  better flaunt it
Another warrant  two of America's most wanted

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny  release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery  sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee  these niggas must be crazy  what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was  but it wasn't  now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz  Blood  gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see  we live by the gun  so we die by the guns  kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch)  tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers  so we made it
No answers to questions  I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me  eternally the most wanted

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit  I'm wit' ya  I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya  do your thing  boy
Yeah  all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust  givin' a motherfuck
Yeah  niggas  'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller  but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl  didn't quite learn
On the block  wit'cha Glock  trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib  sayin' how you've changed
Oh  you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home  just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque  don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie  he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money  all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large  you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin'  I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life  and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart  you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister  but never went up in her
And I can see us after school  we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll  you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip  'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain  then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins  fightin'  playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin'  knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin'  wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time  we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony  lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated  you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight  the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear  'cause Mama  I ain't happy here
I blew trial  no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad  I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell  thinkin'  ""Hell  I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there  so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it  but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well  guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it  hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots  ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity  addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies  escape in the luxury
See  first you was our nigga  but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded  in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb  hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays  and in time  you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me  so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head  when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent  I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto  so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say  but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know  but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah  I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha

Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts  stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies  just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus  I try to focus  but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future  ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin'  tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth  cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie  ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside  make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord  tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin'  got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves  but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts  don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me


I hear the doctor standin' over me  screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes  layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe  something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares  homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin'  tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me  tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry  but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery  talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama  can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies  we gotta eat
No more hesitation  each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police  please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me  only God
Only God can judge me

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live  baby  let me live

Pac  I feel ya  keep servin' it on the reala
For instance  say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first  if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real  got him  lurked him  crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes  now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas  ""You can fade him""
Punk  I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass  glass  big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti  already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch  remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets  representin' the Bay
Pac  when you was locked down  that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts  so sick  but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin'  sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters  I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me  ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off  player shit with 4-Tay

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city  the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings  leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children  'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin'  but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard  maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry  they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried  stressin'  my vision's blurry
The question is will I live  no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger  don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is  what's the use?
Unless we're shootin'  no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world  baby

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself  see
Ladies in stores  Baby Capone's  livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen  full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin'  I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran  a villain  a young thug  who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death  and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up  I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up  now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts  but yo  it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin'  I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales  riskin' 25 with a L  but oh well

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world  baby

With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world  baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world  baby

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death  after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop  study your lessons
Don't settle for less  even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change  keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best  don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches  in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites  they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane  it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends  so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah  nigga  it's all about you

Every other city we go  every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go  I see the same ho
Every other city we go  every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go  I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick  or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well  boo
I gets down like Dru  and my nasty new niggas  too

You couldn't hold me back  it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack  perhaps  it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control  flows'll fold  while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set  I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin'  cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily  try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut  I came to fuck  try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most  I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

Every other city we go  every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go  I see the same ho
Every other city we go  every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go  I see the same ho
Every other city we go  every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go  I see the same ho
Every other city we go  every other video
No matter where I go  I see the same ho

I'm tellin' ya  it's the same old shit
I mean  goddamn  you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back  watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel  I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then  you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean  damn  everywhere I look  everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad  I'm only bein' real  yeah"

Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary  I thrived on misery
Left me alone  I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me  can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato  no longer with us  he's deceased
Call on the sirens  seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery  shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord  I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business  by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green  but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God  can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind  I spend my time in this cell  ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell  where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire  shed so many tears

Lord  I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord  I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary  so many tears
I'm suicidal  so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest  I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces  screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted  I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched  sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match  such a dirty game
No memories  just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord  forgive me for my sins  'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God  I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried  been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives  little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line  gettin' high
This ain't the life for me  I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me  I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately  I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises  think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more  I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord  lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord  I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God  I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears"

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce  thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em  they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed  and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes  see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white  ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

Tell me  do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there  there's a lady  crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder  if they take it all back  will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals  take control  drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done  I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you  don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah  ghetto gospel)

Hahaha  ahahaha  hey man
You a little sucker for love  right?
Word up  hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start  taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts  so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match  perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it  and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud  I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand  if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment  in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm  don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause  you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe  cause soon as I leave  it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back  I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it  but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you  tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong  a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process  keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure  I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes  and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows  a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low  losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave  oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive  and now
You gettin’ calls at the house  guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’  I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me  this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin  I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars  tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray  hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love  happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills  out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home  when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost  trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed  no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it  you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’  when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations  huh
I wanna take your misery  replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me  I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up

What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  do for love
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  (do for love)
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
What you won’t do  (do for love)
You tried everything  but you don’t give up
Do for love  yeah baby yeah
Do for love"

Fuck what you heard  you're mine  you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine  you're mine
I just wanna say  you're mine  you're mine
Fuck what you heard  you're mine  you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time  this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good  girl
One time  this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll  wanna roll with a good girl?
One time  this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood  still treat you like I should
Wassup...

(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me  I'ma go Thriller on you  I'ma just
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you  I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem
You the one they hate  just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to"

To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride  but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy  you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing  maybe my head for one

Or mastered wealth  they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage  still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you  lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down

You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier  5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood  like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse  lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?

I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken

We teach girls to shrink themselves  to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition  but not too much
You should aim to be successful  but not too successful
Otherwise  you will threaten the man""
Because I am female  I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now  marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments  which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social  political
And economic equality of the sexes

I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass  when you put it in your face
By the way  if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine  inner peace  entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

And rock right up to  the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak  baby  peak  baby  peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep  baby  your deep  baby  deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe  over me

Hard  rock  steady  rock  hard  rock  steady
Rock  hard  rock  steady  rock  hard  rock  steady

Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word  you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason  swimming in my love  your love lifting
Higher  harder
Got me screaming to the Lord  boy
Kiss me  pray we don't overflow
Baby  I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it  baby  rock it  baby  rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy  daddy
Ooh child  ooh now  yes Lord  damn baby
Driving me cray  cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me  please
Punish me please
Daddy  what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah  hell yeah  ride me so deep
Ooh  my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah  you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures  consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that  wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers  baby  baby  baby  baby
Cyclical trends  tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit  I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone  so mellow

No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good  rolling solo

Solo  solo  solo  solo

I'm skipping showers and switching socks  sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck  wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo  on time
White leaf on my boxers  green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap  'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't  'cause this nut cost  that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through  but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died  smoking big  rolling solo

Hanging behind my door
The glass was cracked and the man staring back

I'm sorry you're the first”

How can I support a third?

And I'm on the brink
Fallin' deep into debt
Fallin' deep into drink
I can drown those regrets
I don't have to think
Now I'm working the night shift
Asleep at the wheel
I was bursting apart like a flame from a spark
Thinkin' ""Jesus  this can't be for real""

My sweat-soaked mattress
Corner of the room
Cigarettes and matches
In the fading afternoon
And a picture of my kid  yeah  he's smiling
It's the first day of school

She said  ""I found the gun  it was buried beneath
Piles of clothes in the room where your son sleeps
And I can't pretend  to know how this will end"""

I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserable

Following familiar patterns
I'm falling back into ruin
I'm getting serious douche chills
Just being in this room
I couldn't even see the humour
With the situation I was in
Knocking back Jell-O shooters
Till I puked in the kitchen

Used to say  ""Don't quit your day job""

Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take  it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh  now tell me now  tell me now  tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh  the reason I hold on
Ooh  'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh"

Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person

Well  I don’t care I’m in love

And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time

So how do I know that it's right?

And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons  and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons  and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons  and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So  how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So  how will I know I've gone too far?

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh  I love the way you lie

Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war  you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your head
The violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh  I love the way you lie

So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning  you wake  a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby  speak softly  tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby  without you  I’m nothing  I’m so lost  hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am  but that you’ll always love me
Then after that  shove me  in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on  two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs  ’cause we’re that lucky
Together  we move mountains  let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice  yeah  but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times  I’m starting to lose count
But together  we’ll live forever  we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy  we’re nuts  but I refused counseling
This house is too huge  if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground  ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind  without you  I’m out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you  I'll always share

When the sun shine  we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath  I'ma stick it out to the end

When the world has dealt its cards

To see a marching band
He said  ""Son  when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
He said  ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons  and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day  I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade...""

The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all  the rise and fall  the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone  we want you all to know

We'll carry on  we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone  believe me
Your memory will carry on  we'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back  let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on  we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone  believe me
Your memory will carry on  we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on  we carry through the fears (Oh  oh  oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh  oh  oh)
Take a look at me  'cause I could not care at all
Do or die  you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try  you'll never break me
We want it all  we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed  I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here  because it's who we are
I'm just a man  I'm not a hero
Just a boy  who had to sing this song
I'm just a man  I'm not a hero
I don't care!

We'll carry on  we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone  believe me
Your memory will carry on  we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

Do or die  you'll never make me

Up and early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted with a fat-ass fade
End of work  we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane
Rakim  KRS - hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Sometimes I feel I wanna shout  man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way


Christmas Day when your mama got your first bike
Type of feeling when you went and won your first fight
How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally you're living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise
Young man speaking out  now he's loud and clear
Birthin' your child  smile so proud you wear
Going in your 3rd eye for the styles you hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscious like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work
Times I feel I want to shout  man it's real that way
When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way


All up in her vibe something coming over me
Summer days more likely that you notice breeze
Winter days more likely that you notice heat
When I'm gone  more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry  more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke  more appreciation for that scrill(a)
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood
Times I feel I wanna shout  man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way"

Inner breathlessness  outer restlessness
By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath
Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee  prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard  yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble  light particles  articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barter's bard  barb of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A mantra to fill my being in those moments
I am blankness  the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There  in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then  who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me  oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use  uses of us
It's all overwhelming me  oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit. Through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation

The heaven-sent benevolent medicine man reverend
Peddling deliverance that resemble amphetamines to
The residents in the meadow of pestilence
Who developed a chemical dependence on pessimism  now
Is he is  or is he ain't
The most distinctive speaker seeping through your sleepy speakers
Yes he is  oh  yes indeed
So distinguished  so close some people think he's half 
Ain't no secret  people  trust me
It's mostly hustling
That moves me upstream
But just focus on the unseen
Boasting and fussing
They both so unproductive
Suppose it go in my blood stream
Let me pose this question
Ask anybody  that's anybody
They'll tell you that the antibody to the petty
Potty mouth gossiping is
Success at something
To be the best at something
And not to stress the dumb shit
Cause you ain't missing nothing
You got to

Let's give it everything we've got
Ready?
Begin

Alley-alley-alley-alley-oop on amateurs
Air above all and any actors that’s average
Big barbarian basically beasting
Biters get blown up being brave  beatings
Casually  I chef cash cheddar  fools get
Casualties and caught off guard with chin music
Dirty when I drop dimes damaging the dang earth
Devastate the defense detonate danger
Entertainer entertaining everyone and every mass
Enemies is envious ain’t even peep the elbow pass
Fire en fuego flick of the wrist foes in
Fear of the fury left flattened and frozen
Gloves off for the glass jaw by the goons
G.O.A.T of all G.O.A.T.S gone giddy gettin’ through
Human joystick  heating up  heat check BLAM
Hit ‘em hard  hella hyped  hero going H.A.M
I’m isolated on islands it’s over  it’s over
Ice in your veins getting colder
Juke jock jerk to those who aren’t worthy
Jamming through my journey in a jet black jersey
King Kong of K.O.s kid kiss the ring
Knuckle up now with the knuckle buck king
Lemme live a long life leading with my laces out
Right now losers look up cause it’s lights out
My moves marvelous  money shot  massive
Main event  moon-shot  MVP  master
Nails in the coffin knots in their knees  triumph
Nutmeg through their knees nothing but nylon
Opposition oft on the ropes in the octagon
One-two  punched out  lights going off and on
Pillow picked passes of prolific poetry
Power plays  pickpocketing petty phonies
Quest for the cup  it’s quantum y’all  quote me
Quiet all quitters feeling qualms when we’re quarreling
Raw ringside riots relish and remain
Rallying  rough rated rhymes make it rain
Swishin’ on simple soft suckers spitting swag
Slice dice shimmy nothing-but-net  splash
Turnt up  taking out timid minds. Twister
Leave ‘em turnt out  they are truck stick victims
Unstoppable ups  stay uninvolved
Unanimous  universal  year of the underdog
Vicious and vital  victories calling
Volley y’all out victorious velocity
Bob and weave well  wide receiving words woven
Moonwalk when I whip  get the world open
X-celling  X-treme  X-tra X-plosive
X-hilarating X-out competition so quick
Yolo pass rhymes  y’all young bucks fall
Yoga stretch rhymes yelling yiggy yes y’alls
Zero zero zero on the clock  game’s over
Zoomin to the zenith  zero out  in my zone  ZONING!!

 a sound let's go and hold it down just like an anchor do
Don of lyricism how I rank and rule
Bringing fools to a higher level up without all of the dank and brew
They do what they be doing think I make a new style a day my lyrics stretch a mile a day
Hey but who's counting on who got the flow and rhyming insurmountable
The pressure cooker tension's elevating its about to blow up

Everybody make way it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
One time for your mind it's the blowup
Party people in the house it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
Make way make room it's the blowup
Everybody everybody it's the blowup
Check it out ya'll it's the blowup"

First in flight (repeated 4X)
Gil Scott-Heron:
(Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky)

FREE! Like a bird out in the wind in the night
Like a 747 to LA that's in flight
FREE! Like a garden flourishing in the wind
Like a student bout to do it when he's graduatin
FREE! From any of the energy perception
Can never be defined create the definition within
FREE! Just lovin' life itself and never pretend to be
Anything other than the man I was meant to be
Travel through time and get a glimpse of the centuries
To come a better day is promised remember
Free Like my nephew in a few months about to be out the penitentiary
Meditation(repeated 9X)
Chorus

UH! I never hesitate about a reluctant mind
Just put the pedal to the metal see what ya find
You back there slouchin over won't you pick up your spine?
Let's make it really really happen live up this time
Cause you can choose to say ""Good morning  God"" or ""Good God  morning""
With black clouds storming
I walk without umbrellas into these woods
Don't need 'em cause the mighty trees above will shelter me good
I'm eating berries from the bushes of the heavenly good
From the states the power came to us whenever we stood
Reverberatin' out  a-reachin' each and every hood
Whenever we could the spiritual anatomy fool
But never take the credit for it B cause that'd be rude
It's just the way in life we searchin for that had to be new
You gotta work it though cause everyday ain't Saturday fool
Evolve into a better life and be happy with you and you'll be
Chorus

The first to fly
The first to strive
The first to fight to stay alive
The first to win
The first to strike
The first to live
The first in flight

RISE! Like the sun up at the crack of the dawn
Like a wakin child in the morning stretchin and yawnin
RISE! Like an infant being held in the light
Like the smoke from an incense when it's ignited
RISE! If you're sleepin won't you open your eyes again
The greatest high be that natural high within
No need to force in the progression just ride the wind
You'll know the answer to the where and the why and when
If you keep workin' for your search you will find the end
Though at the end you'll find it only begins again
See at the end you see it only begins again
And everything you learn you're only rememberin'
Cause you're
Chorus (repeat 4X)

It's me
Let your mind and your soul be free
Work to shine meet your goal believe
Spread that kind of L-O-V-E
Take some time off the lonely

Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky"

Mopped your whole flock and walked toward ya
Scattered all up on the chalkboard
Socrates self is thoughtless
From farmers to Metropolis

Form mental visual optics

Clock ticks  I'm toxic giving oxygen to the thoughtless
Intoxicant knocking the planet off its axis
Like oxes 
Boxing compin' up out though
Peepin it loose
Seeped in to you
Begin in to the outro...
MC is what I be about though
The freshest with or without though
I can outflow any little doubt your little mouth throw out so
Take it out though  so I'm a gardener
I'm a chef eatin' all you carnivores
I'm an ancient Zen master philosophic thought
Comin' like the Art of War
Handyman with lyrical hardware
And my house ain't made a ginger
But it's made of an array of pages that'll slay ya like a ninja
Unemployed  no  I got work

Which sucker DJ's persist to take
You understand?

When put to his music sound out of sight
You understand?
Master of scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
You understand?

Grabbin' the mic and unravelin' with
The force of a javelin hit
Travelin Gift of Gab and I'm it
MCs are havin a fit
A man and a myth with a hat of magical tricks
Stored in my cabina-net
Jammin' and rippin' the average listener
Cramming in it like a sandwich
A bit at a time
This critical rhyming individual shine your pitiful kind
It's little so little that I will belittle your mind
Nigero tearin' yo ego and spiritual flows
Divine imperial
Signed and delivered  so take time rewind and give it all
Your undivided attention
Divide is in division
Subtraction and addition
See I'm like a mathematician
Egyptologist wisdom
Hip-hop holy man submerging you all in my baptism
Security guard of the rap prison
Slap rhythms into newborns
And birth rap ism into blunts from sacks hittin'
Get 'em off and make fat dividends
Now that's livin'

Do I have to give up my signature?
To get ya to figure out
I'm walking the path that Allah had planted
Or Jah  whoever you give your shout to
If your doubts
Rip you out your physical  watch your spiritual drift up out
Floatin' up on your way to infinity  kiss the clouds
Just about
When you get to the point where the alien ships are out
Tell 'em I sent you to help ya and give ya directions
Wherever you're going so that you don't miss the route
See  I send you traveling far
Unadulterated cleverness
And you'll never catch a flaw
I'm a hip-hop astrologist
And my raps a shooting star
I'm a bartender all into your mental
Sittin' at the bar ventures  force injure
More injure pretenders the inventor of plenty other dozens
Your loving buzzin' at your door like Jehovah witnesses in the fall
If I was your landlord you wouldn't need to pay the rent at all
Just give me applause whenever I floss  that'll be the only cost

Time and time  a brother asks why
The rhyme is not laced with a gangsta touch
I said ""Simply because I don't live that way
Still kickin' them rhymes rugged and rough""
""But that won't sell
Cause you gotta keep it real
So that we can feel
Where you're coming from
Because these streets is ill so if you ain't
Killing niggas in rhymes
Your whole sound's just bubble gum""
I said ""I won't contribute to genocide;
I'd rather try to cultivate the inner side
And try to evolve the frustrated ghetto mind
The devil and his army never been a friend of mine""
""But niggas don't wanna hear that shit"" said the brother
Who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
""murder murder  kill  murder"" instilled in the influential thoughts
Of our kids' heads

Shallow days  you never wanna
Let a brother be a brother
Fully inner to the outer
Caught up in all them hollow nights
Can't escape cause everywhere that I look
People front  and it just ain't right
(repeat)

I said ""Don't you know the powers that be
Are using people as pawns  devouring we
Until they see us all gone and outta the scene""
And as I passed the chronic  he said ""look at where I be
I tried to get a job for real
But all the homies hit liqs and rob and steal
And keep fat pockets caught in a rut to catch ground
This way's in  plus who could you trust?""
I said ""I'm all about protecting mine
But neglected minds be gettin' left behind
Why don't you change your environment?""
He said ""This is all I know
Plus my fam's all that I got  I can't go""
I said ""You gotta make it for the fams""
""Damn "" he said ""I didn't make the ghetto
The ghetto made the man""
I said ""You're more than just that ""
Shook his hand  said ""Damn  you gotta find a way
To break the devil's master plan  peace""

Shallow days  you never wanna
Let a brother be a brother
Fully inner to the outer
Caught up in all them hollow nights
Can't escape cause everywhere that I look
People front  and it just ain't right
(repeat)

The word ""peace"" is just an expression
Used to say bye when it's time to jet
And them red black and green medallions
Was all just part of the trend  I guess
Hardly ever them around brothers' necks no more
Instead of that gold  gats;
Inspiring gangstas and macks
Who at the young age of four
Be seeing more drama than war veterans
Instead of learning God's laws
And hip-hop is a voice that we enlisted
To express how we be feeling about this and that
But music does reflect life
And kids look up to what you're portraying
And mimic what you act like
It's time for a new day
An era in rap  conscious styles
Makin' them aware of the happenings
But their ears seem more steered towards
Self-annihilation so then they might laugh
And write this off  like I'm out here just
Blowing wind  maybe label us soft or unreal
Something they just can't feel  while they yell
""murder murder murder  kill kill kill""

Leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And juveniles is losin' trials  catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinking and drugging  ho-in  searching for their son
And liquor stores upon every corner
And younger people done accepted defeat in

And the hood is all the mic can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket

Glad to knew ya
But give a damn

Hidden truths  given you the lies
You got two pistols at the head of your own people
It's lethal but its living proof
Instead of leaving smiles leading death inside of our living room
And instead of college they got us slangin after highschool
For the love of the money and everything that it will buy you

My mind is militant and will reveal your little innocence
The citizens of villages be like hey Gift  oh you're the man
My nigga can you spit again and kill them with your infinite flow
Did it and made dividends
And exit with your chick in hand

Now and then my style offends
But only if you're out to grip the crown of MCs
Bound to pound the sound and clown and diss the lesser groundedness
So fresh astounding with these records
Y'all ain't shit to us your non-existent flow will fall to shit
You step inside of our existence all of y'all will call your momma Just to save you from the trauma
This is Quannum call your doctor
Get your karma falling all upside your noggin
Stallin' with them rhymes that sound like I was sounding
When I was a toddler barely walkin'
Romping through playschool with slobber falling out my mouth
From ga-ga-in' and goo-goo-in'
It's voodoo when you step into new energy
I threw you when you kick them simple rhymes
That you do when you rap
Fool you in a trap  see me and you doo-doo in your pants
Rule you with my grand iron hand go through you with a lance
As my mind expands I enhance
Do you feel my wrath?
Your girl had told me Gabby  I so love listening to you man

If you were to tune into my show then you had an experience

Because I own them

Yo

We take a journey through music right now (*2X*)

Yo  when music temptations can't be resisted
Fifths will be inconsistent make me a misfit
Listed as a phenomenon I got an oncoming bomb
Which is perfection and flexin' like I spent time in Nam
The beat is on and its nice and easy
Instrumentals blendin' like cinnamon rice and peas
And life's a breeze when you don't have to kick it to find
Contemplate the creation with Blackalicious and I
Tuna fish is full of musical entities past gone
Tryin' to hold fast and grasp hits like last fall
So last long flash on keepin' the past strong
We grab songs and rhythm so people can catch on
Yes
My mic monicker  momma I twice promised her
Love life  if music is truly your wife honor her
Burnin' to your thermometer stretch a million kilometers
Connect a population of Earth to one another for real

Music  deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music  when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin'  one force one love one whole community
Do it  keep travelin' on keep travelin' on

Underground or overboard overlord oh my lord
More and more pure sonic overjoyed soarin' towards shores
Unseen  uncharted bout to get explored
Warriors breakin' all the limits twistin' the laws
Now who said that underground is only just one more
I'm sellin' time and space and matter  making hula-hoops of Saturn's rings
And bring my bing  in sync  to think
That these was meant to be writ and be spit  so ever be writ
We on some destiny (shh shhh) we just a piece of this
We offer testament of every cultural element
Ever sent to us by the ancestors as though we manifest as
Some new world pedestrians
Just lounging with some fishin' poles up on the moons crescent
Just tryin to make some history spittin' on a few records
I had a dream like Martin Luther King in adolescence
And now I'm out in Tokyo and Europe havin' sessions
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present
And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin' off like an army ho replay
Talkin' bout walkin' miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin' bombs with no delay

And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin' off like an army ho replay
Talkin' bout walkin' miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin' bombs with no delay

Music  deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music  when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin'  one force one love one whole community
Do it  keep travelin' on keep travelin' on

Now see we rock around the clock we don't stop for nothin'
Gonna take it to the top - non stop - no frontin'
People listen when it drops cause it speaks to something
In they souls when they all alone  spacing in the zone
Or walking they block - talking to they homey at the shop
See the point is this - even if the homey got shot
Then there still be the bump knockin' in your trunk
Get ya out your slump rockin' it straight off the top
Concotcin' it like ingredients thrown haphazardly inside a crockpot
With a magic sock  schnapps  a big ass book  and some vodka
And pass it my way cause I'm a real big talker
And I love new experiences I'm the godfather of gettin' into to trouble
On the road undercover shit - take your whole crowd if you leave em uncovered
And I believe even hammer would say my shit's proper work
Not to put a damper on the underground answer shit
You dealin' wit motherfuckers  done underground anthems  done
Rocked from the west coast damn near to Athens and you still hate a whack song as much as the next man
And still in love with the good one
We interact with listeners this is our contribution on the war against
The whiteness and slightness  a constitution of fatness
Blackalicious  Jurassic  Maroons  Latyrical madness
Your mind is captured with tactics to get you blasted the fastest
And you still wonder  baffled at just how long does this is lastin'?
We have the fashion to classic the pure love satisfaction
Is when the magic is captured and life actions made tangible with

It ain't nuttin goin on but a party
Now brothers wanna flex but I'm over they heads
I got the funky type of style to rip your vocals to shreds
I'm never runnin from the Feds wearin red Pro Keds

I dedicate that line to Shack from South Central
Not sayin I'm the baddest but I know I got potential
For every black man hung lyrically I lynch you
Your style is kinda dry hope my melody can quench you
My soul is one with all although my ego is against you
See rap is a raw meat  so now I got to mince you
I'm playin rappers out like an old pair of gym shoes
I can do anything  I can do anything
Crusin down the street in my six-four Impala
Is what I'd like to be doin if only I had the dollars
A baller ain't a baller if he ain't got balls
A scholar ain't a scholar if he ain't got scho-lastic
Education  and if not that  then learn from life
Beyond all of the material crap
A human ain't a human if he doesn't make mistakes

A battle ain't a battle if you don't catch scars

Realms of thought you ought not test lest
You be chomped up  like a pop rock  stopped for a
Bead from the weed lady  thought it was the bomb
Really wasn't nuttin but a bag of strong palms
Lost twenty dollars  didn't get high
Maybe next time I use my finances right
Live another day  learn another lesson
Ain't no need to get my mental status cold stressin
That it's so ill that it's fo'-real that it's
No skill displayed  de shades gone now
So it's time to build my own umbrella
Tell it tell her hella mellow fellows loungin
Better bread I never fled a header of the sounds and
All I wanna do is run my own universe
Grab the mic and let my spirit just FLOCK when I croon a verse
Mind over matter  spirit over mind
A doobie and a skin funky breakbeats and rhymes
A true blue homey to the end reminiscin' with your
Sisters in the living room den
A life with a plan  nine acres on a land
Building self by yourself helpin' out a fellow man
Prepare for the essence when your inner soul's free
Before the departure plantin of the right seed
I think what everybody's strivin for is peace of mind
I'm thinkin the world is full of inner places that are out there to find

It's all in me
No maybe

Here we go again
Slip into my conscience  come along an take in
A story bout a battle  in this corner  Satan
Cunning  baffling  and jumping into half the drink
And suddenly disasters and catastrophe
And acting unrationally
Reacting savagely
To passionately
Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating
Jeopardizin' love
Look at all the people that you took advantage of
See your hypnotized
Rom be gone  take another cup
In consequences lurk
While the reaper got your shirt size
Nigga wake up
Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from
(Chorus 2X)

You search for the answers outside
Refocus causin' time and time again  backslide
You've noticed times before the presence of that ""I""
But never did submit to it and let it apply
Whatever be his will in this present life time
Or essence like mine
Know the blessings you might find
If you let your higher power inside
Emerge and apply to every single thing in your balance
You will truly find
Who you really are
Die and become reborn
When God is present in your life than you can come reap on
And ain't a storm that you can't weather
You got a purpose you was born to create
Destiny is waitin' for you
Arms open  take with ya
Knowledge bestowed by the great giver
Lakes  rivers
Mountains and steams
Now reality's the dream wraitha
No more searchin' for truth that was always wit' cha
It had to hit ya through the struggle and the turmoil
Ya soul was planted and it sprouted out above soil
And let the sun shine freely down
At times it looked like it wouldn't
But the plant came to flourish
Now it's standin' on solid ground
(Chorus 2X)

Sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head above the ed if I could be

The sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head up
Above the ed if I could be
Least
If I may
(Chorus 4X)"

I walked to the fertile crescent and built
The sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad
I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the nile
I am a beautiful woman
I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me
For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on
My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save
I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents
I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission
I mean...I...can fly
Like a bird in the sky..."

Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh  is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be

And the days got sold to the grit and the game

As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say  but

Take your records  take your freedom
Take your memories  I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me  you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records  take your freedom
Take your memories  I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Don't worry  I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records  take your freedom
Take your memories  I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Take your records  take your freedom
Take your memories  I don't need them

We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am  I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

We were gonna make it  weren't we  baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night  last-call cover band
'Til the last song played  never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

We were her on my shoulders  lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am  I just miss who I was when we were

Peanuts in a bottle
At ten  two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I love my records
Black  shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country  soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money

Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'

Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on  take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be  my little girl

When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you  I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away  I hear you say  ""Daddy Love You More!""

Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on  take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be  my little girl

Someday  some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know  he's the half
That makes you whole  he has a poet's soul  and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me  he won't be good enough!

On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well  you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me"

Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)

Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

So pick yourself up
You can't change what's been
You must go on
And learn while you live
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead
Then you're right on track for a better end

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
Yeah  life's not out to get you
Get you!

She told him how much she would miss him
Said his goodbyes to his children
And let the weight fade away

But I have my mother's eyes
Your tact and poise
And her sense of wrong and right
Heard you awake in the middle of the night
Letting go of the things you keep inside

Worked your fingers to the bone
To be sent home with a cardboard box
Filled with everything you've known
All things come to be loved and lost

I'll keep a moment sealed in time inside a picture frame
A small reminder of the days I thought would never change
They always say it's clear to see
How parts of you shine through in me
I think you know  you won't be here forever
And you're counting down the days
'Til you can rest your tired eyes and let it slip away

The lessons learned at your side
Will stay with me all my life

Healed my wounds with love and wine

Sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning

Prison cell exercises
Solitary sport entertainment

You're going to die any different?

The vultures will pick your bones dry
Half digested and eternal
Somewhere lost in the ephemeral

We're all presidents  we're all congressmen
We're all cops in waiting
We're the workers of the world
There is the elite and the dispossessed
And it's only about survival
Who has the skill to play the game for all it's worth
And reach an obscure kind of perfection
Let's try and keep as much emotion out of this as possible
Let's try not to remember any names
We'll do it for a country  for a people  for a moral vision
United  we'll make them remember our history
Or how we'd like to be told
How we'd like to be told...

And we rock
Because it's us against them
We found our own reasons to sing
And it's so much less confusing
When lines are drawn like that
When people are either consumers or revolutionaries
Enemies or friends hanging on the fringes
Of the cogs in the system
It's just about knowing where everyone stands
All of a sudden
People start talking 'bout guns
Talking like they're going to war
'Cause they found something to die for
Start taking back what they stole-
Sure beats every other option
But does it make a difference how we get it?
Well do you really fucking get it?
No  no  no  no
No  no  no  no...."

Bloody hell  a common kamikaze

Born to die in the eternal spring

Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with

When I put on that t-shirt  the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn  but from my point of view

I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces  walking on eggshells  fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

They called it Reconstruction  fixed the buildings  dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland

And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

Dear Mr. White Man  I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me  I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django  dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat  I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer  conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history

Oh  Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past  you feel me)
And I just want to make things right

Where all that's left is southern pride

'Cause there's a last time for everything

Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything

Last call  last chance
Last song  last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby  give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)"

High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

I know how to make her laugh
Or blush  or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry

And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing

And a cuss word cause it's Monday

She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying  ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave

Then you swat my hand when I try
Well  now  what can I say at the end of the day

Manicured  waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands

There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah  I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

And  oh  you've got so much goin' for you  goin' right

She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely  don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett  make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it  that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman  she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine

And  oh  you've got so much goin' for you  goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra  mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

You've got so much up ahead  you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

I guess I'll see you in the mirror  when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

And  oh  you've got so much goin' for you  goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night

I wish you wouldn't worry  let it be  hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

And I'll be crushin' it  with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it  when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot  crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead  yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it  oh I'll be crushin' it
I figured this out in college  walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait  I'm the king of getting unwound
And every week has a weekend  by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it  every weekend's a weekend
Yeah I'll be crushin' it  by this time Friday night

Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well  maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret  but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh  I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand  I hate dealing  yeah
Get everything I need then I'm gone  but it ain't stealing
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
But maybe I'll lay down for a little  yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about

Good news  good news  good news
That's all they wanna hear
No  they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying  oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different  what's the difference?

Well  it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas  hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well  so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar  but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah  it's what I do
If you know me  it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon  haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue  yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

Good news  good news  good news
That's all they wanna hear
No  they don't like it when I'm down

It make 'em so uncomfortable

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late  I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late  I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad  ain't so bad

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money  fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine  crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common  they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering  well  wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die  God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders  faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like  how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

Mondays I think of you  but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in  gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you  you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you  I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life  alright
When I get faded you hate it

A little louder
There you go

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes  or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry  I won't hurt you  don't you worry
Listen to me  I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once  baby  you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view  girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart  girl  if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble  can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious  ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed

Well  because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm  I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See me and you  we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish  mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it  I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world  I gotta carry my own
My own  with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone  and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic  I don't sound the alarm

Because I don't need to lie no more

And I learned it from the best  always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime  big butt and nice chest

No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone  move out my mother's home to a world I call my own

Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight  I'll be down for the war

So watch her do the Macarena  somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin'  this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at shit different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that  but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world  you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...

Stay high  go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It won't stop!

You can't fight the feeling  feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling  feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no

Uh  and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me  myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up  do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3  recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money  kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood  woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan  but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts  a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea  we never can agree
They tell you what to know  but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em  ""Fuck what you know  I'm feelin' comfortable""
Just continue livin' life  cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now  cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high  go for what you know
Yeah  Macadelic...
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop cause

You can't fight the feeling  feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no
I told you it won't stop cause
You can't fight the feeling  feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no

Sometimes I wake up  up in the morning  make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Soon as she’s gone and take up
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean the sun is slowly falling  we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?
Identity crises break mirrors  vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul  I know  sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus  stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme  choking
Or soaking up game  I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see  I'll break you down like a pound of fire  whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather  you

You can't fight the feeling  feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no

Uh  think I can see a fucking halo (halo)  about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano)  some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches
He got special needs (sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends  I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature  need an acre for my recipe (please)
They got my soul  but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody  a little like Kenny G's  it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (tailored)  me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader (fader)  sipping mind eraser
Actually  we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you  gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government  abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch (*moan*)
You're Banana Republic fit  go suck a dick!
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt  the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit (I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick (I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth (I said it must be the drugs)

After rapping take my people out for octopus (Spanish  ugh)
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam (Ugh)
Don't hold your hand out for nothing
If you claim to be my man  damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip (Strip)
Blow the dice  roll them shits  hit another trip (King Crack)
Shit  I'm on some shit
Hands are fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime (uh)
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna  it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner  dawggy

Uh  uh  bitch I'm nodding off  I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor  chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake  but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops (stoops) to smoking on roofs (roofs)
I came from that basement  now look at this view (view)
Making this money  blowing it all
Fuck what you did  just show me results

Yo  I'm a 635 dipper  fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot  horses  I led 'em to the brook
If you locked  then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look  I lose money  but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks
I hold the multi-colored flavored gat – blat!

Praying I don't waste it getting faded
Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar
Through the surge  energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard  I still read Babar
Tripping out  looking at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit  they got a app for... that

But me  I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white  but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise  so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons  feel the pressure
Find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me
I'm above the norm
But  give me anybody though  I'll gladly chew his face off  them bath salts
Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt  hot
Haven't picked a major label  think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life  I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from  but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances  but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills  that's the truth  it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So  if you ain't talking 'bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional  special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity  I let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow  I would let it snow
That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe

And if God was a human  it'd be yours truly  watching horror movies
With some foreign groupies  thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy  I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals  it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone  that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now  it's just not the same
I'm looking out my window ashing on the pane
Shit  wonder if I lost my way

Yeah  don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smiling face
Shit  that God fellow may reside in space
As  time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switching the locks  the keys keep changing
Dreaming of places  my own personal creations
If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way  and when you lie down
And when you rise up  I am the lord  your god"

In '09  we were still on the bus  nigga
Before Nak was deluxe  when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright  nigga  I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out  I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound  houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin'  givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win  nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim  color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow  I been drownin' again

I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul  shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul  shallow soul

Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in  yo  yo
The most critically acclaimed  slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia  blunt laced  covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda  so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark  nigga  sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor  and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved  so the tats covered
Real ones  I'm the last brother  when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker

I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul  shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um)  shallow soul (Yeah)

Yeah  well
Isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's
He got a lil' Whitney  put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn)
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house  I tell the bitch  ""Slow down
Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money  just shut up and count"" (Woo)
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work  like he servin' for a sheik
Me  I'm swervin' in the Jeep
Burnin' weed  doin' circles in the street
Yellin'  ""Play my shit or wake the baby up!”
I get her faded  put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power  where did all that go?
The wrong decision always called my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war unknown
Shout out to Soulo (Soul!)  and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of the glory hole (Whoa)
Any time  any place  you could bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road
Look at all these new faces
I see  I see  I see
They comin' on the plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Whoa)
Hate myself up to strangers (Woo)
But the raps are just way too flagrant  so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer  it's a Hail Mary (Whoa)
I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there  it's not just gypsies and fairies
This could be my last breath
(Last breath) I'ma take my time (Send it please)
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

You are standing in a shallow soul
You are speaking with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Tell me why I'm so lonely
Shallow soul  shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Tell myself I'm free
Shallow soul  shallow soul
You are standing in a shallow soul
Uh  I've been without sleep for 80 hours so I'm beyond simple fatigue"

Gettin' faded  I been stoned all week

Twisting my weed  easing my mind

I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin'  that's a hassle
Besides  even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all  if it all ain't me

To get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you
Now our cereal  it is warm
Attractive day in the rubble
Of the night from before
Now I can't walk in a vacuum
I feel ugly  I feel my pores
It's the trees of this day
That I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel tragic
People greet me I'm polite:

What's the day? What's you doing?
How's your mood? How's that song?
Man  it passes right by me
It's behind me  now it's gone
And I can't lift you up  my mind is tired
It's family beaches I desire
A sacred night  we'll watch the fireworks
The frightened babies poo
They've got two...Flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel
That I'm only all I see sometimes

I've been eating with a good friend
Who said ‘A genie made me out of the earth's skin'
In spite of her she's my birth kin
She's spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people out lurking
In dominions of a hot Turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers

What's the best place
That you have seen
All of the hands
That you have shook
Home of the queen of
Everything fancy
Is there a smell
That you can tell
Gives you some peace
Sends you to hell
All of the beds
That you have yearned
Is there a dream to
Where you’d return
Where is the plight
With the most stars
Where do you drink
By Echo guitars
What’s the best shore
Seen from a boat
Miniature heads that
Color the shore line
If you could rest
A minute to tell
Get me some grass
Iridescent shells
I know there’s a nest
Fit with a hatch
Sunset a glowin’
Makes us all sweaty

I don’t even know where to begin
Or how I should start these days
The green mountain south or
The Clay of the westerns
The Maryland meadows at midnight
They do have a misty grace
Take a trip to blue bayou
Find Roy Orbison cryin’
A continent molded from glass
Or maybe a town I can taste
Dresses that glow on
Girls from Barcelona
I wanna discover the key
And open the everywhere place
A mix of sky from Montana

Where is the place
We can extend
Crooked state lines
Polka dot signs
Say that this place is
A state of mind
Pretty lip girls
Paint me the halls
Not on a street
Not near a mall
Raise me a thumb
From human skin
That isn’t judged by
Where it begins
Show me the clams
Show me the pearls
Mail me a note
Sent from a world
That isn’t so far
And always right here
Where all the boundaries
Have disappeared
And all the nights
Are stitched with a glue
That’s sticking to me
And I’ll stick to you
I’ll take your hands
You’ll take my face
And everywhere home will
Be a good place

I found myself there a collagin’
With all of the human race
A dancer from Ghana
Smiling in Tijuana
I Frankenstein java with touches of Prada
And corn on the plates
A smear of gardenia
In the fair hair of sweden
And maybe I actually visited
Some sort of mythical place
Or was it a future
Connected by sutures
Oh let’s go get lost in the image

Forehead is leaking  my AC squeaks and
A voice from the clock says  ""You're not gonna get tired""
My bed is a pool and the walls are on fire
Soak my head in the sink for a while
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet

And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you  we're goin'

It doesn't really matter  I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze  get a midnight meal
I point in the windows  you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard  smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go while our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yawn  you'll be sleeping soon

And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again
When the sun goes down  we'll go out again

Don't cool off  I like your warmth

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it wets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls us  that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked  but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace

And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

Just you  just you  just you  just you
Just you  just you  just you  just you
Just you  just you  just you  just you

I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that
Likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze a thing or two at night
It'd make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays
I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you
An accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative  I know
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if its empty it definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear Khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well  silence is a bore

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative  I know
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. Well  hello...
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle  found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part 
Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause its in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my do's and still feel ill
You get that WOOOO! "

I'm beaming

Pulling me into another dream
A lucid dream
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things that only I should see

And not for boys  they're just for me
Hurry to talk from far away
I can see you  you curl your fists and you pull your hair
When we're alone I wanna say
Let's just stay in
No one's here in our apartment  babe

Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there

I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting rushed back on a whim
Our breaths get wind
Back to the time when we were green
I know we have changed but I still grin
Cause I can't wait to see you
Back to the time I touched your hair
When I was so scared to look that mean  I think it's weird
I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things that only I should see

Who was high in a field
From her movement
Caught my breath on my way home
Couldn't stop that spinning force
I felt envy
Everything around seemed to giggle glee
She walked up with a flower and I cared

Saw the dancer
Who gets wild to the beats of record rhythms
But I'm always away for weeks
That pass slow my
Mind gets lost
Feeling envy for the kid who'll dance despite anything
I walk out in the flowers and feel better

If I could just leave my body for the night

Then we could be dancing
No more missing you while I'm gone
There we could be dancing
And you'd smile and say  ""I like this song""
And when our eyes will meet then
We will recognize nothing's wrong
And I wouldn't feel so selfish
I won't be this way very long

To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time

While we were dancing
Early hours
Drunken days finally ended
And the streets turned for a pillowcase
Then I fumbled our good lock
Then the ecstasy turns to rising light
Through our windowpane
Now I'm gone
I left flowers for you there"

Someone in my dictionary's up to no good
I never find the very special words I should
So I have another party with a water glass
And I sit on all your actions it's a birthing game
And I'll bet he needs a shower cause he's just like me
And the soldiers in the painting know your secret face
Well your parrot told me just how I can make you smile
Gonna let you do your thinking if you need awhile
But what I gave you made him get mad
A little bit funny how a thing like that
Could travel from one mouth in through another and
The next thing you know you gotta hear it from your brother and
The words they sting like a stump of old wasps
Do you remember when I said go throw the rock in there?
And we ran through the woods to our good house
And you forgot about the things that he could say like
I don't think that I like you anymore
Well I found new feelings at the feeling store
And I can't find you at our kissing place
And I'm scared of those new pair of eyes you have
So I duck out and go down to find the swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
Caused when I'm snuffed out I doubt I'll find a swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
But I don't wish that I was dead
Now a very old friend of mine once said
That either way you look at it
You have your fits I have my fits but feeling is good
Confusions not a kidney stone in my brain
But if we're miscommunicating  do we feel the same?
Then either way you look at it
You have your fits I have my fits but feeling is good
So I duck out and go down to find the swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool

So complex and brave
A power and lure without showing some legs
Different roads  not just sexual things
Went and cut a rude hue  said it did right away
And I’m keeping it new  and relearning girls again
It’s a strange kind of plot who steps and paves the golden way
With a humor that is known to quickly put me in my place

Let me watch the mark of maleness from a table side in greys
I can only dream of how I’d be so amazed

For all of this and more  I give them praise
(""A man? Fly trap"")

But sex and gender bring some troubles to the fray
And trouble tears apart another golden heart

She said I’ll be here for you later  boy
Now run along you have to fall

But don’t believe that she should change at all
Golden Gal taught me restraint
She said you'll want me more much later  dude
I'm your everything and not your toy

And I might want to stand in line
To find the kind of mind she can provide

A Peacebone got found in the dinosaur wing
Well I've been jumpin all over  but my views were slowly shrinking
I was a jugular vein in a juggler’s girl
I was supposedly leaking the most interesting colors

While half of my fingers are dipped in the sand
You progress in letters but you're used to cooking broccoli
The other side of takeout is mildew on rice

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the ""old times""
Then we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow  it's your insides
You're just an inside  adjust your insides  you're just an inside

I bet the monster was happy when we made him a maze
'Cause he don’t understand intentions and he just looks at your face
I bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bath
And all the birds are very curious  all the fish were at the surface

With half of me waiting for myself to get calm
I'm like a pelican at red tide
I'm a corpse  I'm not a fisherman and
A blow out does not mean I will have a good night

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the ""old times""
Then we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow  it's your insides
You're just an inside. Adjust your insides. You're just an inside

Well I start in a hose and I'll end in a yard
When I feel like I’m stealing I can't keep myself from hearing God
Only the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the ground
It was the clouds that carved the mountains
It was the mountains that made the kids scream

Oh well she bore all her parts but
She never was found
You think I'll carve a path through New York
And be an artist  but are you anything
Then you find out that you can’t ask a baby to cry

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the ""old times""
When we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow  it's your inside
Adjust your insides. You're just an inside

Get all tangled up in arms and legs it's cramped up and
Someone grabs a hold do you go ohhhhhh?
Should you go home?
There's something starting dont know why
And in a house so cozy few words are spoken
Let's take our shoes off and unwind
When there's minuets off in the background drowning out
Eyes off ears off test the kiss goodnight
A kiss goodnight
Don't keep my loving on my mind
Because it's messy yes this mess is mine
Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine
Look we have similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns
Do the elderly couples still kiss and hug and
Grab their big wrinkly skin so tough wrinkly wrink wrink wrinkly rough

Give me rabies bring you babies at the hospital
Violent ends with friends that go
I kissed a few in sticky shoes our cartoon show is broken

You could win a rabbit  you could have a rabbit or
If the fast child is going to have a dead hand
We can get him started  yeah
Bad mind  let me put on good habits
Been working to put on good habits
Sometimes I can't find my good habits
Spanish bands use all the echo
Persian kitties better stay out of the train
Glad you brought your food on
Eat it like it's going to get away
Your coffee sure is getting colder
The seats are getting fewer
Place is losing space
You could win a rabbit  you could blow an island through the rib
Rabbit or a habit  habit or a rib?

Asking my friend

In a living room filled with arts and crafts
He said ""I like their clothes and their charming ways
But what I really want is a simple place
With no fashion clothes cause you can't eat those""

Only Ma'd pretend to like the clothes you showed to me
Something in my heart can tell me it's a weakness
And maybe you will have more luck playing those tasty games
But me  I called and called and never heard from her again
She's too good to share our favorite things

Let them crawl into the logs that dam
Brown jeans  the hue of their path
Excited and screamin' their voices grow wild
And rise with the birds mating up in the pines
Down to puddles that breathe  covered by leaves
With mud they'll make prints on their backs

If they're awake 'til the dawn
Well  we won't fret that they don't have our eye

And then I woke  you slept there on your side

And light our two shadows  I watch with delight

Or to be more like their dad?

Two stumps of meat below me
A false snow fall could ruin my day

And winter's love where could she be?
She's warming in my pocket

Just a calm and modern day

Am I a better person?

I pulled the boy out of a box
And made that boy a man"

The stone for the curse you have blamed me

To neverless wonder  happy will I become

Please  don’t run your mouth
The questions before have no place in this haunted house
Reveal your selfish pleasure
One more time 'round for good measure
In the answer you hold
Time would be better off if our souls had been sold

In the place where the blind truly can see
Hear my voice  dearly departed  I beg on my knees

Shed your skin and expose your bones (Hey! Hey! Hey!)

And follow us into the black (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

And toss in the lives that you can’t be bothered to save
With their blood on your hands
You enjoy the sun while you shit in the purest sand
Kiss your lover with that filthy mouth
You fucking monster
Here as evil now gropes
It’s caught us off guard with its hands reaching for our throats

There’s no telling when the truth is clear  pay it no mind
Lines were drawn for us  for all sides
In the afterglow  echoes of time unfold
Give me your word  my dear  and promise you won’t let go
You may rest inside the night
You can't save what the sleep implies
It’s a shame  I fear  from end to start
We walked their lines  born to play the fucking part
A shame  I fear  from end to start
We walked their lines  born to play the fucking part

I fear we've got all we had wanted
Close your eyes and believe it didn’t happen
Now shut your mouth beyond your lies
The world knows to stay away from you
In the blood you let run  they march as you lead
We laugh in the sun  maybe that’s all we need
I  and I  and I’m sorry
You can’t escape

Here where the light only dies to remember
A place where the blind truly can see
Hear my voice  dearly departed  I beg on my knees

With this rappity brat  packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap  yap-yap  yackety-yack
And at the exact same time  I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic  I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period  here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God  Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod
Now  who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard  that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well  to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz  2Pac  N.W.A  Cube  hey Doc  Ren
Yella  Eazy  thank you  they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C.  induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game  'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and  tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face  lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place  lookin' boy
""Oy vey  that boy's gay!""—that's all they say  lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up  pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day  lookin' boy
Hey  lookin' boy! What you say  lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre  lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have  never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face  lookin' boy!
Basically  boy  you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace  lookin' boy  'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God  Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track  call me NASCAR  NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park  the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no  Asgard  Asgard

So you'll be Thor  I'll be Odin
You rodent  I'm omnipotent
Let off  then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead  but I'm just a talkin' head  a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common  poodle
I'm a Doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil
It's me  my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line  add an AK-47  a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was  but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal  comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya  like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day  ""Hey Fab  I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh  summa-lumma  dooma-lumma  you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating  more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading  and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off  they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music  you make elevator music
""Oh  he's too mainstream.""
Well  that's what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop  it's pop ""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock  shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains  I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice  your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh  school flunky  pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself  but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues  but it's still tongue-in-cheek  fuck you
I'm drunk  so  Satan  take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz  still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have  then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it  life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad  and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?"

You yellin' at the mic  your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait  you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line  compliment me on the next
Damn  I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter  I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan  Stan  son
Listen  man  Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke  eyes open  undeniable
Supplyin' smoke  got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope  but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling  ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim  you're old"")—ow  Kelly  ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29  I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you  woo!
Ho  chill  actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch  you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill  sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead  that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl  milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em  Kelly  I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo  Slim  your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery "" oh shoot  that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me  lil' goof
Luxury  oh  you broke  bitch? Yeah  I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you  ho
Younger me? No  you the wack me  it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city  lil' kiddy  go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake  I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie  no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho  you about to really blow
Kelly  they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja  next to Benzino—die  motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain  you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I  mwah  give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back  aim
Yeah  bitch  pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it  as big as you're gonna get  so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep  I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me  and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows  long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting  letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel  bitch  get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero  we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater  your black leather
You dress better  I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic  I just don't like you  prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot  I will not fail  I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But  Kells  the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed  ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are  and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'—oh

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it  or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty  knees weak  arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already  mom's spaghetti
He's nervous  but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs  but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down  the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth  but the words won't come out
He's choking  how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out  time's up  over—blaow!
Snap back to reality  ope there goes gravity  ope
There goes Rabbit  he choked  he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy  no  he won't have it  he knows
His whole back's to these ropes  it don't matter  he's dope
He knows that but he's broke  he's so stagnant  he knows

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking  make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem  it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter  he blows  it's all over
These hoes is all on him  coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter  lonely roads
God only knows  he's grown farther from home  he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose  'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo'  he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada  and so the soap opera
Is told  it unfolds  I suppose it's old  partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom  da-dom  dah-dah  dah-dah

No more games  I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning  the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man  these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie  there's no Mekhi Phifer  this is my life
And these times are so hard  and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed  plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama  screamin' on her  too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot  another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail  I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom  I love you  but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go  it's my shot: feet  fail me not

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me  stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy  yeah  you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well  guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public  excuse me
For wantin' my cake  and eat it too  and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew  see  but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink  used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery  ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep  two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think  ‘cause I'm—

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me  stop holdin' your breath

Well  that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now  I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow  so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah  ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind  the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head  keep knockin'
Nobody's home  I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger  I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy  but I have this vision  one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then  drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's  blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle  feels it and relates  that's great!
It's payback  Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft  turn nothin' into somethin'  still can make that
Straw into gold  chump  I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real  but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin'  I'm still friends with the—

I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)

I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you  just know you gon' suffer this time

Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines

Just only me and my shotty  I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money  I never wanted the lifestyle

This is payback in a way  I regret it that I did it

Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker  bend the law  fuck the rules

I just ate  licked the plate  my buffet  lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me  ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said  ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say  ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject  it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta  why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it  I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus  you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap  way back  MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's  where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin'  face tats  syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap  and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact  where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back  I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back  ho (Get it?)
On the brink  any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit  I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made  I never cater
Motherfucker  now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off  I'm workin' tirelessly  ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought  y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall  that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

So y'all gotta move (Yeah)  y'all gotta move (Yeah)  y'all gotta move
Give me some room  give me some room  give me the juice
Hop out the coupe  hop out the coupe  hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move  y'all gotta move  give me the juice"

Yeah (Illa  Illa  Illa)
Yo  I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts  and see where this takes me  ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate  I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed  but make no mistake  I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet  I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch  I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker  shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’  lil' bitch
I’m sorry  wait  what's your talent? Oh  critiquin'
My talent? Oh  bitch  I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me  millions of views  attention in news
I mention you  lose-lose for me  win-win for you
Billions of views  your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks  but bitch  you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued  business as us'
Shit-list renewed  so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi  yo  adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty  but not me though
Not even dissin'  it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit  preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill  y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill  probably I will
Old me killed the new me  watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror  I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead  I must be possessed
Like an evil spell  I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick  stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence  bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ  man  how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit  so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch  I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough  nah  turn the Valium up (Illa  Illa  Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at  I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like  ""Man  how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week  an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang  chicken wang  MGK  Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump  Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game  pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry  I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you  that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you  if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean  then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head  because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded  but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge  but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless  all I'll ever be is honest (Illa  Illa  Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs  my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side  never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep  not even a wink  I don't blink
I don't doze off  I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw  man! That BET cypher was weak  it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God  that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all  if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine  or you think water is pink
""Dawg  that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look  there's an apple!"" — ""No  it's not  it's a peach!""
So finger-bang  Pootie Tang
Burger King  Gucci Gang  dookie  dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway  doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse  bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand  was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless  it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing  but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me  critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back  I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said  ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up  hold up  hold up)
I said  my beef is more meaty  a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes  I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"

All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me

So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched  to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks  mismatched
On his breath's Jack  he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match  she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually  just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger  psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl  even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand  says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy  to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him  I don't care
Hi Suzanne  but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night  but tonight I am

I've been a liar  been a thief
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
Well  little one  I don't want to admit to something

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight  scram "" now we hug tight  and...
He found out  now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left  so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words  I'm aloof  nervous  and Sue
Don't want this to hurt  but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal  I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio  like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible  I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach  my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world  shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar  been a thief
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
Well  little one  I don't want to admit to something

My name's (ooh)  my name's (ooh)
River (ooh)  river run
Call me (ooh)  call me (ooh)
River (ooh)  we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid  never ""The bride  hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave  I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate  like I'm slidin' on ice  maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck  tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort  but fuck it
What's one more lie  to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar  been a thief
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
Well  little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)

Bitch  this shit don't fly in our city
Punk  you don't disrespect OGs  R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated  though made it
So that there's no shame  it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch  she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper  I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in  I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury  Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin  I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen  I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables  I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible  indefensible  despicable  difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable  I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with  the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk  bug  soldier
Tongue  shrub  shoulder  one month older
Sponge  mug  folder  nun  rug  holster
Lug nut  coaster  lung  jug  roaster
Young Thug poster  unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike  there's nada like us—

Gotta concentrate  against the clock I race
Got no time to waste  I'm already late  I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic  word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke  'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late  it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar  I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute  they're mockin' JAY
Next minute  they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate  I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin'  I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

Don't fall on my faith  oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap  he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again  I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain  you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it  ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""

It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls  you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words  more than just two letters

And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors  I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose  from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em  get 'em there  get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers  I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most  I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope  put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for  the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very'  yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar  you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own  thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here  clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins  the Logics  the Coles  the

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

Fire  Godzilla  fire  monster

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx  told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see  will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal  voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall  pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness  the mythological

The motherfuckin' finger (Finger)  prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants  I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out  I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake  yeah)

Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips  you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything  incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it  but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila  kill or be killed  I'm a killer bee  the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
And be on the receiving end of me  what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity  motherfucker  you better duck

Dear Slim  I wrote you  but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell  my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn  you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways  fuck it  what's been up  man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too  I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter  guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too  I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day  but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures  man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too  that shit was phat
Anyways  I hope you get this  man  hit me back
Just to chat  truly yours  your biggest fan  this is Stan

Dear Slim  you still ain't called or wrote  I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad  I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert  you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother  man  he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you  for four hours  and you just said no
That's pretty shitty  man  you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you  man  he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad  though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you  you would write back
See  I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day  I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline  the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See  everything you say is real  and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you  Slim  no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me  man  I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you  I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now  I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey  Slim  I drank a fifth of vodka  you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins  ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't  then Phil saw it all  then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late  I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you  Slim  we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now  I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See  Slim—shut up  bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey  Slim  that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat  I just tied her up—See? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well  gotta go  I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh  shit  I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

Dear Stan  I meant to write you sooner  but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now  how far along is she?
Look  I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show  I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin'  dawg  come on  how fucked up is you?
You got some issues  Stan  I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter  I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself  I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little  I'm glad I inspire you  but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape  but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it  his name was—it was you  damn…"

Enter in  and up under your skin like a splinter

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me  I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works

But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms  I stretch  but I can’t reach
A far cry from it  or it's in my grasp  but as
Soon as I grab  squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet  now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high  butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp  gripe  and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow  so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking  because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—  it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard  that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy  love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect  the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car  listen and pick it apart
Like  ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this  still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god  this is retarded
If only they knew  it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished

Making my mistakes  oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down  oh

It's true  I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile  yes  I goof and I jest
A flawed human  I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em  but first
The ""Speedom"" verse  now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast  is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls  eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline  the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set  I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt  remind
Now take your best rhyme  outdo it  now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site  outta mind  I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though  I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around  'cause—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human  just like you
I've been making my mistakes  oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down  oh
If I walked on water  I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic  I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

Hah  yeah  I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me  Islamic Nazi  that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
Wedgie in my underwear  the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack  kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked  bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap  I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome  stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart  you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone  crash into everything

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin'  I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by  Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes  twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot  I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon  here I go
Eyes closed  blindfolded  I'm 'bout to—

Take a look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45  that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again  I guarantee that
Wait  that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair  my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift  beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible  better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here  serial killin' every beat there is
Wait  wait  got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin'  I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah  it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?)  12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait  but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track  I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views  but you're still below me
Mine are higher  so when you compare our views  you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat  will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced  suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah  wait  no way  you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did  did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing  you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead  he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka  chicka  chicka  Slim Shady  I'm sick of him
Look at him  walkin' around  grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who "" ""Yeah  but he's so cute though.""
Yeah  I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't  but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips  my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky  you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course  they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel  don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well  some of us  cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel  I got the antidote
Women  wave your pantyhose  sing the chorus  and it goes—

I'm Slim Shady  yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up  please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady  yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up  please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well  I do  so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me  let alone stand me
""But Slim  what if you win  wouldn't it be weird?""
Why  so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit  Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah  he's cute  but I think he's married to Kim  hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me  so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me  who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk  talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing  but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady  yes I'm the real Shady

I'm like a head trip to listen to  ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it  I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny  ‘cause at the rate  I'm going  when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking  but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King  spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot  circling  screaming  ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time  loud as you can  how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady  yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up  please stand up?

It's like I'm in this dirt  digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio  you're
Right back on it  reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well  looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed  for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh  you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine  but you seem to be doin' fine
Well  I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying  ""Let it go  fuck this.""
Heart's saying  ""I will  once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh  you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth  but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me  I ruh-uh-un; follow me  I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me  I ruh-uh-un; follow me  I ruh-uh-un)

And to think I used to think you was the shit  bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped  shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time  you better go and get the sewing kit  bitch!
Finish this stitch  so you can reap what you sew  nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him  pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him  same shit you did to me  cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters  you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it  I'm coming to see you
And  gee  who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage  and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof  then I'm gone  voosh

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh  you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth  but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me  I ruh-uh-un; follow me  I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address  park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived  and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See  it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya  but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully  and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep  still bent low  then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo  sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man  door handles unlocked  shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag  chloroform rag  dag  almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung  stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular  huh? Now who's a faggot  you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me  you and the music now  Slim  I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait  here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey  here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now  ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M  Matthew Mitchell
Bitch  I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much  I figured  what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits  time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped  no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea  as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh  God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot  at least
New plan  Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well  gotta go  almost at the bridge
Ha ha  big bro  it's for you; Slim  this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh  hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope  it's hopeless  I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over  here we go all over again
Back's to the wall  I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged  yeah  ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished  I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you  every woman you insult
Batter  but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers  the rapper's persona
Is half a facade  and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off  sad  but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say  “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away  I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have  but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact  then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So  one last time  I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice  the magic that started
It all  tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured  trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off"

(Yo left  yo left  yo left  right  left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left  yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right  left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left  yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right  left  yo left)
And not be a quitter  no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left  yo left  right  left)
Flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not  then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts  when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs  spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal  cop-killin'  hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me  feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot  lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle  my wizzle  this is the plot  listen up
You bizzles forgot  Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off  'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Music is like magic  there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit  and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment  and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it  try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over  just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list  here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie  Jay-Z  2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast  Jada  Kurupt  Nas  and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list  the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it  but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream  like Bobby and Whitney — Nate  hit me!

'Til the roof comes off  'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off  'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts  I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me  smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served  my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth  that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic  I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps  who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest  so

'Til the roof comes off  'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off  'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out  can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out  am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)

Well  that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well  that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is  I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now  there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe  but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right  it's like I'm in flight
High off her love  drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her  the more I suffer  I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown  she resuscitates
Me  she fuckin' hates me  and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No  you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back  here we go again
It's so insane  'cause when it's goin' good  it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back  she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad  it's awful  I feel so ashamed
I snapped  ""Who's that dude?""  I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her  I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well  that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well  that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet  and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'  yeah  them chills  used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em  never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push  pull each other's hair  scratch  claw  bit 'em
Throw 'em down  pin 'em  so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over  it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways  guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today  that was yesterday  yesterday is over
It's a different day  sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her  next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance  life is no Nintendo game  but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well  that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well  that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now  I know we said things  did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns  same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is  you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded  baby  please
Come back  it wasn't you  baby  it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside  pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault  look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed  I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize  even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games  I just want her back  I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again  I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire  just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well  that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well  that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

But I didn't stop  ‘cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you  I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life  love  stress  and setbacks
Yes  you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday  was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath  reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday  was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath  reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?

I'm shook  I know I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could  I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front  I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions  I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant  make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter  this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky  get to see you out the corner of…

Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?

And when you left  I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept  it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up  it was booked up
Put it all behind you  the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared  but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry  it's official
I was a fistful  I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder  anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you  ‘cause you passed away  Dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath  reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?"

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor  I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot  to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom  I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far  with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere  it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear  then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness  I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you  I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak  now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance  through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live  'cause God loves ugly

God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis  yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - ""Who is it?""
My name's Slug  I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other  so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down  with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm  and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen  and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow  he advised me not to worry
Said  I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light  a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows  and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly

God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly

Why scream  when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff  reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid  walking around  careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly  God loves-God loves ugly

How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet  hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me
Couple of advil  relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass  right into that patch of grass like that's life
All of a sudden  I realize something
The weather is amazing  even the birds are bumpin
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken  it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like

Sunshine  sunshine  it's fine
I feel it in my skin  warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines  whoah let it shine
Sunshine  sunshine  it's fine
I feel it in my skin  warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines  whoah let it shine
Sunshine  sunshine  it's fine
I feel it in my skin  warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines  whoah let it shine
Sunshine  sunshine  it's fine
I feel it in my skin  warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines  whoah let it shine

If I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin hard
Settle down  barbeque in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
Every day that gets to pass is a success
And every woman looks better in a sun dress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops  get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices  I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin my bike around these lakes man
Feelin like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these southside trees
Leanin' up against one  watchin the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress  thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple  I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right  stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up  bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime
Summer summers fine
Feel it in my skin  warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines  woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it"

Now I don't know what that means  but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right  that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
""Get real""  they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am  would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See  I'm not insane  in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking  ""Yo where did all the passion go?""
East coast  West coast  down South  Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America  but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents
It's eat  sleep  fuck  and self-defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait  let's prey on the blind  deaf  dumb  dead
Hustle  maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah  I got some last words  fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent  love is the motive  that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent  blame it on my equilibrium

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next-door neighbor
Working hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the plot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess"

And get out of this bathroom
And call management to seek some reimbursement

Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers  trails  fuck waves and rails
Fuck hangovers  fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations  mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition  kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance  now it's more that I consume it
When it boards up my room  the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy  autopsy pages read euthanasia  i.e. irony
Well here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated  windows dilated  comatose  life overdose

She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you  I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you  how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you  Lucy  for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother  I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel  so I can deal with touch
It's like that  thank you very much  fuck you very much

Fuck the 'What happened?' I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck  used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star-fighter was wounded  time to give it up
On a pick it up mission  kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road  took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama  hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further  the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes  read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake  how much time did I waste?
Fuck you  Lucy  for leaving me
Fuck you  Lucy  for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you because I still love you
No  I'm not okay  and I don't know what to do

Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point  five points make a fist
You close em'  you swing em'  it's hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch  but if the boot fits
I got an idea  you should get a tattoo that says warning
That's all  just a warning  so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath  and avoid you  sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream  ""Fuck you  Lucy""
But the problem is I love you  Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover

About 5 foot 5  big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful  dark eyes  a strong stare
Large lips  soft hands  and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you

I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling  but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that

Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it  I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror  she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest  speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest  before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset  it cramps the position
And if you didn't know  you better listen (you better listen 'cause)

I will show you all you need to know

To emo kids that got too many feelings

I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head  shake the song off
Another manic Monday night  its gonna be a long walk
A car pulled up  a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli  placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal  I lit one up and walked
So they got back in they Oldsmobile  belted up  and took off
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens
Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine
As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks  reminded me of my old roots
I walk past with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got  exactly what we've been building
All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No  he's a young'un  but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen  he looks frantic  no  he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
""Do you want this? It's not mine  I promise
I found it on my block in between a couple garages
Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over
I don't even know how to hold it""
It was a thirty eight  the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand  thinking damn man it's heavier than expected
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil  even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak
But over there on the corner saw what I needed
And proceeded to cross the street
Put the heat in the mail box to lose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road  thinking about the old
I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow
Right here  this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love  I've gotten drunk  I've gotten beat up in that parking lot
I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades
These alleyways  and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave
All the way to the grave  south side is my resting place
Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared
The clouds ran away  opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen  standing in my backyard
Face to face  eye to eye  staring at the last star
I should've known  walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here  I was still all alone
No matter where I am  no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
They can leave me for dead they can take away my true
I'm always coming back home to you
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew
I'm always coming back home to you
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew
I'm always coming back home to you
No matter where I am  no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
If only I had known what you already knew
I'm always coming back home to you
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through
I'm always coming back home to you
I'm always coming back home to you"

Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you  assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire cause it's freezing
I can't believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start  but we can still catch up
You need to wake up  we should eat and then pack up

That's when I noticed your foot prints
The snow's fresh and those have been put since
What  you're already up making the rounds?
So where you at now  you laid back down?
The breeze came and it stalled out the flame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer  so I opened up the flap
It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps
Around the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return  no concern
I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowing strong  minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone

It ain't right  start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go and search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
Another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belong to a big wolf

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt  though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew what was behind you
Stalking ya  maybe watching ya
Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivating'  wanna take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad it goes
Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood  it doesn't look good
Your fan club doubled  now you've got another wolf
And the odds are in favor of the home team
Why'd you walk off all alone  where you going?
It ain't the right time to complain  but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains

Your foot prints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run  so I did the same
Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train
Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
And so did theirs  so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest  expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene  sober
It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder
And I'll admit: Hell yeah  I felt fear
The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear
Looking at the snow it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I can't process  I don't follow
It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed
With no sign of death  no sign of struggle
No signs of blood  no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped
The tracks kept going and I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again

It's not that tragic  it's not a shame
You're not the hunted  you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted  you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became"

And right then is when we paired up
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself
You should taste what I felt
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles
Don't let your heart grow cold like a popsicle
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal
And right then we started speeding towards Reno
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle
I'm a 70 deuce  that year was a classic
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it
She said that she was unimpressed
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West

Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck  put 'em up  put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care  oh yeah

She said she needed a place to feel free
And right then we started building a team
Trying to make a better perfect  a little purpose
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance
But ever since people started measuring time
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind
Take a load off or take your clothes off
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock
She said she needed something that she could blame
And right then is when I offered my name
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain
So I'mma share it with you  so you can complain too
She said she want to find a cure for death
I know she meant that in the purest sense
But when I finally die  put on your Sunday best
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care  oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care  oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck  put 'em up  put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care  oh yeah

Take pictures
Run like the parallel stitches
Attach my feet to the path I beat
Teach myself to keep the answers brief
Gnash my teeth like the last to feast
Imagine me on that abandoned beach
Sand and sea as if the jazz was free
I’m Ice cream mixed with gasoline
Direct attention to the craftsmanship
Neglect to mention that the past will stick
Like initials carved in the concrete
Like the tattoo that hides on your mommy
I still kick it with angels
The difference is instead of the bar  I’m at my kitchen table
The starlight shines through the glass
But you feel safe underneath that mask

Ferris Wheel  give rides
The scars healed in time to get high
Lock the doors and hide the keys
Let's go describe how to climb a tree
Don’t sign the lease just cop a corner
For you to curl up and try to sleep
Those cheap police won't find my wings
I keep my dreams inside my dreams
And If I had a time machine
I’d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean
It kind a seems  quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial
Now give me all the cash out the drawer
Touch that mustache down on the floor
And I’ll be in court holding a pitchfork
'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport

Pocket watch  impatient
Find a mate then make the migration
Break the rules  but first break the rulers
And keep it moving like a rumor
I don’t need to defend my defensiveness
I keep to myself  my family  and friendships
I’ve got enough people I could disappoint
If you disagree I think you missed the point
Now go ahead and grab a chair
Let me tell you about the last few years
Pulled out a sack full of Samson’s hair
And put it on the dash like a dancin’ bear
I wrote you a horoscope
It won't fit on this post-it note
But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote
It goes fuck it  you might as well row that boat"

Tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive;
She was beautiful  but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
Would've intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed too hunger (sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (in surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of em I've hurt
And every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire

Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'm gonna talk to my cigarette
And that television set

Anything to take away from the current situation

No overtime pay  no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter around the corner guaranteein' that my car dies

We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color
There won't be nothing left to paint on

My better half is mad at making magic out of canned goods
My tax bracket status her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smoking weed at a concert
And if I smack em everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doin' much better
And we making competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg  in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late  wait
The money ain't here the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Some time it seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away
The only guarantee in life is a life worth dyin' for
Cause death don't wait for no one

To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore

And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

Riding the public transit  I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines  to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her  I attempted to embrace her  she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success  I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman  don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs  he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart  but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go  Aquarius  Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came  without the glove  numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain
Make the love  paint the picture  write the song
The player met a virgin  made a Virgo  named him Sean
Make the love  paint the picture  write the song
The player met a virgin  made a Virgo  named him Sean

The distance grew between Eye and I
And at the end  even though we didn’t speak enough
You were easily one of the best people I’ve loved
Now I’m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter
That wrote they own songs about life and death
And every breath is full of self-awareness
Don’t ever be afraid to be embarrassed

Go ahead and get mad at God
Point your fingers at your dad and at Santa Claus
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off

It goes one for the bar tab  two for the shine
Let's go to your car  do another line
Barely trust 'em  they're all puppets
Love is nothin'  scared of success
One for the bass  two for the drums
Last call gonna take whatever comes
Barely trust 'em  they're all puppets
Love is nothin'  scared of success

I think it's great how you used to be great
I can't hate on how you choose to relate
But I know that you had the potential
I understand why you wanted to let go
A lot of pressure in the middle of those shoulders
And we ain't getting nothin' but older
Ain't nothin' changed but the day we run from
But nobody knows that better than you  huh?

I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend  thanks for listening

Dear Craig  what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah  me? Well  you know  you know  same old  same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah  I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down  I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30  can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them  and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride  fists  and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate  don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you  old man

Dear Sean  what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you  trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose  it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes  messing up your voice
Too many arguments  trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice  but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old  your raps are exhausted
Stop it  everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner  curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says  ""Hi dad""  your dad says  ""What's up?""
And me  I wanna thank you  but I won't  I'll just say  ""Good luck."""

And she treats me like some type of common vagrant
I see her every day  but there's nothing to say
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe
I only get to sit if I buy something to eat
Otherwise it's best to keep my feet moving down that street
And god damn she's a hard bitch
Talks at me like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage
Yeah I know that the toilet is for customers
You ain't got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work
It doesn't have to be a game of patty cake
But it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway
And by the way  I can see it in your eyes
You're angry with your life  not a stranger to the fight
I bet you hate every man that you date
And you're probably addicted to all types of escape
You take it out on me that you're all alone
When you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones
Watch the tone when you speak to old folks
I'm grown  just trying to get out of this Minnesota cold

Look lady  I'm homeless  I'm crazy
I'm so hopeless I'm suicidal daily
If you and I can't co-exist  let's fake it
'Cause I ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship

I'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me
And transport me to the ever after happily
Maybe reincarnated with luck
Come back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup
She said she's had it up to here
She's gonna call authorities if I don't disappear
I love her threats  it rejuvenates my breath
I give her stress for the reaction that it gets
I got a pocket full of panhandled money
On a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun
In front of everyone she calls me bum
But she notices my absence on them afternoons I don't come
So here I am  thorn in her hip
Holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips
Ignoring the insults and evil eyes
I feed off of 'em  I wonder when she'll realize
That she's the only reason I visit
The only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence
And if my ship ever comes  I'll miss it
Because I'm getting old and I ain't got much left to give it
So there it is and I have to live with it
I had the chance to make a difference  but I didn't
In the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water
Thinking: ""Damn  I should've been a better father to my daughter"""

Who is always by your side
(By your side  by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide

May you always (always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)
Rewind!
Rewind!
I remember that night  I just might
I remember that night  I just might
I remember that night  I remember that—

I remember that night  I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander  I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi ”
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame  ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game…

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean  you forget yourself
You’re like me  I’ve never been satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name's Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant  there’s a million things I haven’t done
Just you wait  just you wait...

So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom  of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it  right?
The conversation lasted two minutes  maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement  it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture  it’s a bit of a stance
He’s a bit of a flirt  but I’m ‘a give him a chance
I asked about his fam’ly  did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting  he looked askance
He’s penniless  he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome  boy  does he know it!
Peach fuzz  and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
And that elevates his status  I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going  Angelica  he was right
You will never be satisfied
(I will never be satisfied)
(I will never be satisfied)

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say  “I’m fine”
But she’d be lying
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

To the groom!
(To the groom  to the groom  to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride  to the bride  to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica  Angelica  Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side  by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide  you provide)
May you always
Be satisfied
And I know (yeah)
She’ll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied"

Take this pain from me

Mista Dobalina is a serpent  don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes  even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask  all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester  Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart  so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

At least if you wanna run with my team
I'm 'bout to get into some shit that I've seen
This fool's breath hummin' so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin' too close to him on BART  like my eyes sting
I try to be subtle  hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on hum
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum  gotta gets him some
He turned it down  his teeth was brown
Excruciating  foreign  it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
'Cause his coat had the stench of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O
He didn't know  used to the fragrance
'Cause as the days went without bathing
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread  and fungus
Said he worked on peoples' toilets with plungers
Girls  not the guy you would want to tongue ya
So guys take your cue from this little number

You gotta wash your ass  if you must
You gotta wash your hair  if you must
You gotta brush your teeth  if you must
Or else you'll be funky
You gotta wash your ass  if you must
You gotta wash your hair  if you must

Now in class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holding conversations
Crackin' on each other  and neither were poster boys
Both of 'em smell like the type that soap avoid
Coast enjoyed a leave of absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone  girls would never bring him home
I was laughin'  then his friend raised his tone
And said  ""Bud  you earled all over yourself "" yeah
I go so deep on your ass  you'll be submerged
Like you need to do in water 'cause you smell like a turd
Wanna cap? Get some courage  your feet smell lurid
Go look it up  and while you're at it  get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin' of shit  said I was frail
I said he was stale
Underarms is ripe
Undergarments tight  about to leap out your holey sweats
And we holdin' bets  and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check  yourself
Respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive  no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map  bitch

You gotta wash your ass  if you must
You gotta wash your hair  if you must
You gotta brush your teeth  if you must
Or else you'll be funky

Every single time and I rhyme like I know so I flow
With the gifted tongue and the cryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with the day-o
Day-ay-ayo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee in the ears of my peers
So they know  and I know  we all know  day-o
Daylight come and me wanna go home
Cool
No tool  no Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite so I can pop a bit of
Shit on the mic when I get on the mic
""B-b-b-bam!"" I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it  just like the girl on Ahonetwo
D-E-L will C-R-U-S-H anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito
Veto is the answer when I prance upon your skull like a Frito
Finito  but I ain't finished
'Til I let the flipside ride 'til the rhythm is diminished

I would if I could but I ain't 'cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law. Who's raw?
You saw the views from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a Cisco  and you're like a cider; watery
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to  kept you  on your toes
As my rep grew  I leapt through  negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we’ve done
Received one good 'cause I’m armed like a sleeve  son
Plead dumb and step back  as I wreck shop
Collect respect  props and deck the next prop  artist
The hardest is the one who don’t pass out
If Tyson’s last name was Rophone  I’d knock his ass out
The bigger the better  the better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this  nigga is  gettin’ his
Be real and don’t kill  with flaws the ill cause
Just answer to the boss
And that’s when ya lost
Keep on losin'  I'm usin' many tactics
I yearn to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n

I needs no sugar crisp to get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift? Tajai
I sense those who try to scale my ladder
Bladders release upon your porch if you don’t cease
I respond with beats and will distraction
When I see one fatter than Rerun  so What’s Happening?
It’s not where you’re from  it’s just how you come
Correct  respect the roughneck 'cause 'nuff get
Bucked and tucked into their beds like “nighty  nighty""
Deft of the membrane  none left 'cause I am a righty
Fight these  you’ll catch volleys for your follies and mistakes
I stick fakes with shanks  so no thanks
Wack shit  your attempts to rap are ineffectual
I get in butt styles like a hard-up homosexual
Not for sex when you’re at the intersection  of damage
Sandwich knuckles are what your luck pulls
Bad ones  catch one or two  rather a few
A slew for soft ass phonies plus your cronies
Try me  you’ll catch my Vans in your hiney
That’s if my bat grip slips though I doubt it
Pout if you want to  covertly to find me
But I See’s more than them Candies  nothing gets by me
So play the tracks  and you’ll go out like Betamax
Next to Tajai 'cause I kicks the greater tracks

Sce-beep-boop
Bob your head to this  mischievous  soul societal
Idle chatter never slips off the lips of this writer
Might not be the greater innovator of the rhyme scheme
My style is the Visine to get your eyes opening
This Raggedy Andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You're hip-to-the-hop I kick; I trip the light fantastic
Gettin' into the groove better than a phonographic
The vandal with the vocals making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speaks sustenance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise us like divinity
The one of liberated soul controls for infinity
Got style by the square mile  cats got a vibe child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to prop prophets as I ponder and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen  pay attention  I’m the master of this convention
Kick the wicked-and-wiley-styley while you’re stuttering just like Smiley
Skipping shingles of your shattered dreams  too bad it seems you tried me
The wise and wordy wizard pays a visit to your subconscious
Crush your wonderland  extinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic  stylistic  mystic myth  I’m swift
Like Mercury  mercy me  I'll surely shoot the gift

People call me souped just because I'm living fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads  leavin' devils dead
Never said never ‘cause a clever head's better
Dreads locked on the top of my crop  never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn’t shake me
Bake me  Betty Crocker’s oven isn’t hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins then I got a lotta stuff
Not a bluff  got a tough guy thinkin' twice
Why step? 'Cause a fly rep  I kepts  my step ladder

Sittin' on a futon  slippin' my Timb boots on

I could hook a ho and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb  Adam got a lotta dough
Need help with your garden? Skyline got a lotta hoes
Yo  I didn't mean hoes  yo  I meant women
If she got the pool  I got the trunks; let's go swimming
Dip  dip  dive 'cause I'm live

I'm the black bomber
Track charmer
Sack burner
Distract burdens

Nerve prints
Word sentinel invisible infidel interstellar
Hella clever
Endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail cause you average
Regardless of your sales and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a Landcruiser
Down MacArthur
Artistic archer
Autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Ichabod
I infuriated  tick you off
Stick to Pop
Hip-Hop's too difficult
To me  it's a cult
Lyrics lacerated  slit cha throat
Beat cha brain down like Piscopo when sniffin' coke
I don't know  Diff'rent Strokes
So respect me 'fore I whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testes
Purposely improve you just to see who the best be

Take a poll and know the prestige

My throat holds verbal choke holds
Poke holes in ya scrolls
My goals are not rifles
I flow scrimmage like the Micronauts
You might go pop and I might grow crops
Go get the gestapo
You riskin' a pot full of gold
Pull a zodiac sign to halftime
Reenact rhymes from a past life over flashlights
Man  you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Blow your balderdash
Coordinates confirm
Subordinates will learn
My ordinance is stern so supportin' my firm
Is the only way in this lonely age where you going crazed
Your style is sold and paid for cause I made more
Water emcees like on bay shore
Bullets graze doors (Where)
In Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL with napalm
Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier
Now miser
Strider
Spit exciter
Ripping plywood
Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
What I make is so hot  it's seethin'
Off the deep end
Stop your breathin'
Caught cha sleeping
Now you're peaking like you've eaten
A hundred microdots wreck your equinox
Delete every piece of props

You're claustraphobic  when I close in
In on your men and your faculty  you wack'll be
Out my face  you must be basin if you think
That you could tackle the triumphant  I pump it  the volume
Increase as you mieces get sliced to pieces
Please listen to my album
Even if you're white like talcum and unpaid get'cha stayin
Tuned with my tune and I presume and see doom  designated
To anyone who stated
A word against me  I serve an MC  simply
Put like my foot up your anus  ya Shamus
Tryin to get over  I'mma go for mine
You know the time now that I'm older I'm gonna
Rip niggas heads with the said salutations
Introducing Del and his bid for boostin tales
Of my adventures  attempt to try
And you will limp or die  whichever I choose  you lose
Crews get ashamed cause we blame 'em for bitin
You might win  if you start writin  and stop fightin
No time for games
I rearrange my vocals in your heaphones
I hold 'til I get a answer
Acknowledge and abolish all the wack records
Hieroglyphics  you know  repected

Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend  there's no need for alarm

I get juiced when I let loose a little of my cleverness
Open up my follicles with no mousse
Choose your weapon  you kept steppin
You're swept in a hurricane  Del'll blow your brain
So your next generations of youth will be facin the truth
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth
Gums get split if you bit
I'll extract the truth out your ass like I'm standin in the pulpit
Or a lie detector wrecked ya sector  when you're standing
I can swing  branding  expanding  on what I'm handing
To the people  cause we will  and you can't say
A damn thing about it  if you doubt it
You're already outta line  so let me remind your behind
About the switch which I used to bruise your bottom
That little nigga tried to cut  I caught him
He didn't think that I would see that
So be that  and be off the D cause we rap
We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time
And still got the time to unwind


Weak MC's make me earl
Hurl as your world is crushed because I gotta make you hush
You gotta be eliminated  the way I demonstrate it
You hate it  but still I am the greatest
Like a boxer  I'mma knock your socks off
Nowhere to run to  exits are blocked off
Steadily I'm dissin men  I hope you're listenin
Brothers like my flow
Others ride my jock like a bicycle  but I'm psycho
Fools try to play me like Tyco  gotsta pull the rifle
Daisy  graze the ass with the bee-bee
It comes speedy  sign the peace treaty
Or you'll be needin
Medical attention when I leave you bleedin
Throw a monkey wrench in your program
Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad  son
Catch a bad one

Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend  there's no need for alarm
Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a foe I'm gonna break your fuckin arm!

We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and some swishers too
So we can roll a fat blunt and get perved
Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland where they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin dank and split the profit 50/50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now  first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe  my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
But then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and bucked and family was outside with trauma
We heard the shots from inside and whenever gats go off
I hit the deck and hide
And if po-po said they got there on time they lied
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it ain't nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out (yeah  yeah)

On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and don't take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that sleight of hand
The panhandlers  they not no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
It sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway  we pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the produce ain't good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin me in my community - fuck it  we there
Ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little stroll through the April spring air
We hide our shit so the Nation don't see it there"

Getting callouses turning over asteroids
Graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed
Now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Features splatter 'cross the screen
Get more clean each year

I remember my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision-every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr.  Venture  Roc'n Rope
Games I thought was dope
While my moms was watching soaps

I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doom world
Waiting on the next devil
Armor's low-check the arsenal
Rupture the main conductor playin Disruptor

Got all the past hits and classics
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei
Originality that made me a fan today

It's Pandemonium-it's like Toys R Us
Flippin the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us
It's poisonous
Taking out the boys in blue in Grand Theft Auto
Snatch a Rolls Royce to use

Yeah  I'll admit it Playstation improved
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it

I'll fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter my swords in his innards
My joint was playing Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter

I gotta get Xenogears-that's the type of game that relieves my fears
Get it from overseas to here
I gotta get Psychic Force
Authentic arcade that I can endorse
They got me liking imports

I'll need to be at the next E3
What's the next CD I need to see
Me and D signing checks
Let's float overseas  mingle with game companies
Giving tips to Capcom and Sega-can't front on these

To anyone who knew me better
Know I chose Saturn first Cause it's 2-D heaven
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge
X-men Vs. Streetfighter could've expanded the market

Marvel Vs. Capcom-beyond fathom
Tell the truth  Playstation ain't ready to have 'em

'Coz I might spill my drink

Give me the keys  I'm OK
Quit tellin' me I'm drunk  I only had five Hurricanes
Quit bein' such a Puritan  I'm a mega turrican
Wakin' up and it's all a blur again
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm still alive...
Red Skull more like skull and crossbones
Took my driver's test straight pilin' over the cones
It ain't funny so don't you dare chuckle
Drivin' hella drunk without my beltbuckle
Fuck you  I'm OK
That's what they all say
Already got a suspended license
Smokin' weed in my ride and lightin' incense
Not knowin' it could be gone in an instant
Pistons pumpin'  slumpin'
Over the steering wheel
So many drunk drivers on the road
It's killing fields
Who gives a fuck?
If I get caught all I get
Is a slap on the wrist
My license tooken is a bitch
But I still drive with a D.U.I
Crash  see my passenger fly
Through the windshield
It's hard to see you die
Heads crushed  necks severed from the shards
That's what happens playing with a wild card
How do you feel on trial for killin' your girl?
Nineteen years old  the end of the world
Don't know what to do
Pop's is gonna' kill you
Twelve gauge shotgun to your grill smooth
Got you in a predicament
If I'm drivin' drunk I've got a sickness
Some fool's is shiftless
Like me  gifted
Student GPA: four point oh
Blood alcohol level past that though

I never drink and drive
'Cuz I might spill my drink

Three o'clock  time to go
One more line of coke with cognac
But my cognitive skills ain't on the shit
What now Sherlock?
Key to the lock
My friend's is tellin' me to stop
Damn near down the block
I found the cops in the bushes peekin'
Plus it's the weekend and I'm off the deep end
I roll through an alley way  can't see
Getting antsy I hop on the interstate but it's late
Cops patrol but I don't give a fuck though
I swerve to the right and get stuck in a mudhole
Check the rearview  the coast is clear
Tryin' to focus here but I can't
Drunk as hell  bust a rail
Now I'm sailin' off the cliff
High off the spliff  plus a fifth
I bust my shit
Now I'm rollin' down the side like a suicide
What will my family do if I die?
Tension builds  I went through hills and trees
Stopped by a redwood first thing broke was knees
I feel pain then a split second later
Car burst into flames  they won't know my name
They'll have to check my dental records
My body is charred
Burnt to a crisp soon as the car flipped the crash
That's my ass  a thing of the past
Already dead by the impact of airbags

First day off probation  no wastin' time
Just like ancient times  and take a dime and roll it
Blaze it with no fear
After havin' to take piss tests for a whole year
Smokin' with a cold beer makes me kinda think
Why I don't like to drink heavily  cause what my P.O. was tellin' me
'You can't smoke and even eat poppy seeds
But you can buy liquor  and drink all you need'
It's callin' me  I used to drink Heineken's
Now it's 'bout 5 or 10  plus wine and gin
Hennessy  finishing the last drop
To the liquor store was a cash crop
Drive right past the grass spot
Doin' the dumbest shit I ever did in my life
Riskin' my life
Resistin' arrest
It's in my flesh
Probably smell funny
And there go Del's money
Fast forward to 1998
I smash more herb than those old day's
With a whole J to the face
Nah  I'm still feelin' gettin' drunk more than weed
But now we back in Amster-D  got some grams for me
Chocolate Thai and Purple Haze
And blocks of hash that make the J's last for days
Rollin' up so phat  circumference stuffed with major chronic
We can put a wager on it
When we first got out here in Europe it was everywhere
Even at the gas station  I was down in the mat
A fast pace  when I thought 'This shit ain't helpin' nothin'
When I can get elevated straight puffin' nothin''

(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
The smokin' sessions was the best in the world
Plus the price was right  affordable  so more to use
So fat they deserve the Kodak
And no tax so I'm savin'
Not misbehavin'
That's a risk we takin'  we ain't talkin' bout that
We in the outback  smokin' till my mouth's black  how's that?
I never fucked up a show being blowed
I sorta didn't get it crunk
When I was drunk
Slow that liquor down boy  hit this BM  Bob Marley
A tribute
Cause it's probably as fat as it was he rolled
When he strolled
Down the same cobble stone streets
With his own beats
Another generation  a different time zone
With his mind blown  thinkin' up divine poems
Blessed by the father and it gets him farther
It's a father of spiritualities  since it all affects the Karma
I used the herb for good purposes
Some people are sure to diss  but up in Amsterdam they nurture it
And I can't forget about Crystania
This kid is brainia
Try to sell hard drugs there then they claimin' ya
Life  they only deal with real shit
All the bomb and hash you want to deal it
And all's well  they don't even sell it for much
And the cops don't really touch  cause it ain't slangin' dust
I'm writin' this  right now under the influence
But if you'd just torch those that say I shouldn't do this
Bob Marley'd out  at least 'til I'm back by the lake
But I might roll 1 or 2 for old times sake...

Light skin girls lack the dark skin quality
Ya don't understand? You want an explanation?
Well let D-E-L release the frustration
As I see it  every single day
Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way  always
Plus they act stuck up
They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No  ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See  ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful  to me  that's beauty
×2
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
 I disagree homeboy

Now  lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1  has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain  selfish and rude
Personality  with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her. She wish she was light  though
I mean lighter than light  or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see  green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did  static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now  look at her  her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated  well  lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on  step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts  so brothers don't forget this
×2

I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly  so honest  so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete  not phony or a fake like you are
See  Del is bolder  I tap you on the shoulder
And say  ""Hey lighty  could you tap that sister for me?""
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her  cause the girl looked better than you

Can't be pigeonholed  anything goes gringo

Here we go - up jumps the outcast  sever the connection
My mostly overconfident acquaintances pull numbers
To the anti-potients and fear that I drip sick in
And rise out of my shell to teach sick or bedridden emcees
Til they fear living
Blockin the cocks that bust shots  spittin smitten bitches
Til the day of the locust  kitchen cutlery cuts

Shared with acne pick brain pit
Tried to capture the moment of subtle death
Destro magnet spit - action fit into capsules
Slipped in the dirty waterway speaker cabinets
Maximum b-boy axiom stabbin shit
Intellectual women find that my rhyme style relaxes them
And wonder if I fuck to the same wildstyle pattern
It's autobahn pipe bomb glass fragment shatter
To break new jacks at after parties for actin actual
Factor X into your formula for fresh thoughts
With a Megalon wingspan that bulge from the back of the text radical
Radio time tracks flatten your flattery
The tradition excuse used by biters; ambiguously homo
Knotted tights and colored underwear
That's wrapped around the brittle legs of
Things without weapons - I'm grief diseased brethren
Swim in a sea of shit and malt liquor  feed on Excedrin
Radiate through tenements; emcees bleed estrogen!
Chorus: Del and El-P
Watch insanity increase
Break it up piece by piece
Never weak in the least
Think you better see a priest
(Mortality  don't battle me  it's costly
We the raw breed all of y'all is just the offspring)
 Yo Del gimme that shit again

Tomahawking your tom-tom club
You tried to holler at me at my show  lookin like you on drugs
You love the Del I'll thug you  bumpin Juvenile
Thinkin you in style  packin like you movin now
I move top speed  scott free with cock-D
Knock-kneed delivery that scorches you like Lockheed
Dr. Decibel  my deliverance is questionable
But as far as this session goes I'm wreckin skulls
Better check your pulse  we visionaries with this
Scarin the shit outta record labels next to fatal
Right beside homocide bonafied bewilderment
Militant diligence like I'm buildin pyramids
Peel your cap reveal your lack of flavor
Track your pager plus your celly
Piss on your Pele Pele  catch you comin out of belly
Dumbin out daily  tell me  what was your rationale
Think of matchin Del I disconect your PacTell
My mobile code words  showboat with no hope
For any rhyme you kick or any beat you load up
Leave you catatonic off a bag of chronic  skanless with anthems
Stomp your little cadence out at random

Ran-random  ran-random
El and Del-aphonic known to go off on a tantrum
Now you know..
For the backpackers  for the computer hackers
For the misplaced famous  for all the video gamers
For the derranged krylon stain makers
For the ungry hungry ass verbal brain rapists
That New York to the Bay shit!

Uhhh
Del's back  go get ya life preserver
Aquaman with the flow you might get murdered
You get caught in the slipstream
When I was fifteen
I was ripping
You were shoplifting
My accent on rap is smashin'
Emcees be past tense
Didn't make the draft pick
Come get ya ass kicked
You awful
And slothful
I'm grease lightning
Hit cha with shit that's uncalled-for
Leave ya jaw broke
Tryna simulate
Gimme a break
You rhyme purely functional
Merely fills the gap
I'm a rhymin' mercenary
I'mma kill the track
My brainstorm cause a cloud burst
Bring forth a rhyme like childbirth
Style search
Tearin' out the whereabouts of lyrics
Somethin' you don't care about
I eviscerate your mental state
Into strips of steak
I'mma situate barbituates to get you baked
Your effeminate image is far from intimidating
Cause my style you're imitating
That's as sin as Satan
Your corny insubordinate rhymes are like a porno flick
Compared to Edgar Allan  you spread your talent thin
You gotta problem with balancing
Ya equilibrium is givin' up
Ya symmetry is imagery
Your videos are pretty dull
Big budget
But my poetry you covet
Mega-destructive
You can't fuck with
I'm loony wit language
This artform is truly endangered
So I change it  never doing the same shit
I'll make a profit off of oxygen
Phenomenon wit no homonyms
Hit 'em wit a sonic boom
Eradicate ya nom de plume
Procure of insert a word wit hypodermic earnest
And leave ya burnin' like a furnace
Poetry protagonist
Leave you havin' strict
Advocate of whatever I'm imagining
That's what's happening
Party-goers call me Yoda
I use my force with fortitude
Just sure to groove
And support my crew
Hiero
Vital
Components in the lineage
Of Hip-Hop heritage
Where we go is limitless
(Chorus)
Let's follow along with the rhyme y'all
I bet some of y'all get lost and can't find y'all
Just on a mission to let you know that I'm raw
With the Jaw Gymnastics verbals for your minds y'all

I'm the difference between Hanna Barbara and Hannibal the Barbarian
The metal stiletto ghetto cesarean
Word carryin' clarion
My drum kicks got blood on a steel toe
Nasty like crud on a dildo
For real though
Bram bisque gets bust and break a baller for his billfold
Better beware boy before the shotty make ya body prostrate
Huh
Before they dope make ya eyes dilate
My rhymes'll gyrate
Irate
Liquid spills covering nine states
Liftin' crime rates
Shiftin' earth plates
Casual amongst the ranks of greats
Bitch niggas get treated and took out like dates
They lightweights
Have dat ass beggin' for another day like Nate
Your hard
Boulevard facade'll get you scarred
Get cha shit served preserved
Banned  canned and jarred
And labeled as a fable
Ya unstable
My methods on the mic make money under the table
Pay-Per-View  Digital-TV  or Cable
By cell phone  via satellite  or right at cha label
Hell  you can even send an email
I rip that ass in 500K detail
Use a seasheall
In an ocean of emotion
Periless notions of my delicate delivery devotion

Minimal effort make our shit sound phat
Delvon
And Smash Boogie
We gets down like that
You know I grab the mic and hit cha tit for tat
Delvon
And Smash Boogie
We gets down like that
(Chorus 2X)
Let's follow along with the rhyme y'all
I bet some of y'all get lost and can't find y'all
Just on a mission to let you know that I'm raw

Too expensive  it's too expensive
Too expensive  you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say  whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

My vast knowledge of rhyme is past college
Blast  demolish  polish off all enemies
I can't fall in this rap game  I got acrophobia
Plus half these rappers out here are fucking dead like necrophilia
You know the thing  chocolate like Ovaltine
Comin down on the mic like eggs from ovaries
Monarchal metaphor  malevolent with settlements
Maniacal when Hiero flow  unstoppable and chock full
Of funk. The freak  so fuck the foreplay
Del has been ordained to terrorize your brain
The diagnosis  the show biz is bogus
My lyrics lash out  like I was throwin stones in a glass house
Rappers pass out  ass out
And anyone left on the scene who has doubts
Y'all fools ain't got no nuts I'm doin donuts
Slow up whoever show up  I'm too robust
So what? I'm invincible invisible lyrics
Original origin unknown from here on in
Uncommon dominating hip hop
Permiating every portal with mortals
More flows Heaven scent  microphone etiquette
And lyrics up for your goblin and kill the novice
I write bad subjects like the Hobbit
And on to the next phase before you try to rob it
You know  D-E-L  yeah!

""Time is too expensive""
Too expensive  it's too expensive
Too expensive  you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say  whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

Supreme MC's reach out when I'm on top
Catch altitude sickness not to use fitness
In front of witnesses get with this fetch the funk
While I test the skunk  see I will caress the blunt
Come step through the flames of Hades or remain a lady
Rhymes infectious as rabies -- Deltron  hell on earth
Prevailing curtailing  you're shattered with data
Directed  my method  hectic  try and dissect it
Next shit  hydrauling we're calling you out
I rap with accuracy - I'm sick of fools actin
Like they blacker than me - y' know  usually bourgeoi'
We a new breed of MC remedy
For inner street jerks who wanna flirt with our sound
But ain't really down  silly clowns Barnum and Bailey rejects
Press eject on defects (yeah)
These threats delivered signed and sealed by the Delmeister
German for master  burnin the blasphemous
Whatever you ask of us gets fullfilled
Non-linear  you couldn't find a flow friendlier
Or even similar with beats that knock
Those who cock block transport 'em to the chop shop
Operation X cause we often facin death
And fake ass players are lost and wastin breath

""Time is too expensive""
Too expensive  it's too expensive
Too expensive  you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say  whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

Lyrical master  turnin mic sessions to disaster areas
I'll wax your derriere
Disable MC's with fatal degrees and flows
Flamboyant flamin fools like mesquite  let's eat
These barbeques are for you
We are the few the proud the Hieroglyphics
Microphone moguls with code words and hand signals
For negros  spanish for black
I'll vanish your raps  at the borderline
Where you can order rhymes
Never monochromatic  y'all know the habits of Del
Talented  creating lyrical Gallaghers
Highest caliber  hip hop puritan
Throw my voice like shuriken  or ventriloquists
Until it sit in your cerebrum  I need them
Through the medium of music  too sick
The ratio is glaciar  Gigantor
My flow is lighter fluid  you'll need a higher druid
Magicians and Mages  to curb my primal rages
My styles all over the place  disease contagious
And treacherous (what?) like Mussolini (uh-huh)
But cooler than Fonzarelli eating fusilli
With roots in hip-hop goin back to Whodini
Who see me  no eyes  your style is corny like bow ties
No fries  keep that shake for a keep sake
As well as patened Del hysteria
Malaria area  88 bait for bitin MC's
They're bitin to see  see that's like a likin disease

What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Cause it don’t tick it don’t mean it don’t tock
The hands don’t stop when the cuckoo leave the clock
There’s nothing harder to stop than that who’s time has come to pass
Del the Funky Homosapien says
On behalf of my behind I feel it is my duty to my booty
That I come in ahead of the class when it comes to butts
Old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to give the poor dog a bone
But when she bent over  Rover drove her  the dog had a bone of his own
He did the loose booty
Del the Funky Homosapien  yeah he’s nasty  he's nasty

I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X
Two turntables and a spark upon his set
Wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers
Rap is outta control that's what we fear
So we collapse any actual threats
With the new batch of catchy little quirks
And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm any listeners
Coming through crisper on your transistors
So we can eliminate the frauds
Filled with pride as the audience applauds
Might sound odd to the average Joe Shmoe
The new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo  dodo
Me and CM-PX both construct
Like Kid Creole and the Coconuts
As we drop the bomb with a blast
And now all the natives ask...
What is a booty and how do I know if I'm shaking it?
What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Booty do your duty
Somebody say a tail is nothing but a long booty
Funk’em just to see the look on they face

Boo boo head  boo boo head  boo boo head
I want you dead
I want you bled & bleeding
Needing medical assistance  resistance
Ya kiss meant nuthin'
You was bluffin'
Stuffin' my brain with insane thoughts & notions
Most intelligent people freak you
Because they'll know
You'll give ya all
Give up your drawers
Flap ya jaws & lyin'

Instead of the murda
I'll just tell everybody what I heard of

D: All a this over boo boo heads
K: All a this  all a this...
Back in elementary school
You made me drool
I was cool
& rules were never broken
A token
Of our friendship
All my friends flippin' somersaults
The fault was not yours
Of course  they didn't know  yo
Grils was yucky
Clear 'round & get slapped like a puck-y
But you never said 'Phuck me'
That wasn't in the pictua
I couldn't hit ya with ya hair & braids
And the games we played
Were fun
Till one day a friend said
'Boo boo heads turn red  in the face
When you place
Ya hands on her ass
In class  and give a spank
A banka full of fun
At recess  and be fresh.'
OK  I'll try it
And die if she does
But she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real
But now I'm older
And told ya to keel over
Cause now it's different
No innocence
And women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly
I dig G's
Disrespectin' rep
Now it's when they shish-kebabin' brothers
Try and rob another
And I'll rub ya the wrong way
Let the song play


Ooh  I wanna smack you
Mack you & attack you
Even if you black you get no slack
Sue
Call a lawyer
Boy  ya never knew
Ya crew is on a mission
Every weekend
Freakin' & kissin'
With other than ya man
Lets turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less & guess
& take a gander
I slander ya name & spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll
Be ya middle name
In the game of love & happiness
Yes  I caressed ya flesh
But if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby  maybe I can crave the
One that saves thee
Reputation  ya'll lets face it
Ya basin'
Smokin'  leavin' niggas broken
& open
But I scope in to ya brain
Gain & remain & clues ya use for protection
Now who's next in...

No no no

That it would be this way

I was plannin' to pursue another quest for the bus
I had to go to San Fran  it's something that I can't stand
It's beggin' for a ride with ma dukes makes a fuss
I don't like fussin' so I ask my older cousin
Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift
He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the day
I had to go and sift through pennies in my jeans
To many it may seem that the public transportation really isn't keen
And I agree with the theory
Because it's 3:30 and the bus was due at 2:35
I iron my Girbauds so I can wait with pride
I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high
From a spliff that I smoked  I riffed and provoked
A little scene when the bus arrived late like a joke
With a corny punchline  and it was only lunchtime
The bus should've been here  the driver had much time
To get is act together  no matter what the weather
Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever

When oh when is the bus gonna come
I'm getting sick and tired of the wait
When oh when is the bus gonna come
Well here comes a pack of about 4 teens
Lookin' real mean with hoodies and jeans
And bad attitudes and I wasn't in the mood
For no head on collision with the hoods
Try to use my transfer but it's no good
Would these rough lookin' kids get busy with the youngsta
Amongst the many who must catch rapid transit to get through the city
I'm not certain
But if I go sit in the back it's curtains
Kids wanna ride the back  what kinda shit is that?
Nowadays niggas can't wait to hit the back
Let me stand in the front with the elderly
So those other cats won't raise hell with me

Oh golly gee  not another day on the 46A
I should've caught the 46B
Cause dukes takes the mass scene and group through the trees
And shoots the breeze with the ladies
Look at that around the way girl. Yeah  I see her
More crack than a drug dealer
A kid sits by me with a gang of afro sheen on
I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on
My shoulder and try to hold a conversation
Cause I don't have the patience
When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination
Question over space and time  wastin' time
Word up  I can't take this line of nitwits
I'm about to have a fit quick
Cause this trip here is making me car sick
Check out the brother with the loaded .38
Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes
Sellin' crack viles like pancakes
To baseheads just like the one
That's sittin by the window starvin' for a fix
He spent his last 80 cents on fare
He raises up and lets me get in his chair
Then I sit and take a snooze
But I still lose
Cause I cruise right past my stop
Had to get off and walk 15 blocks"

And I donate to science  cause I'm a giver

Back in your head like you dead but instead you was buggin

But first  chill  I gotta little story to tell ya
How I almost caught a... bad one
Add one to the list of 2 001 stupid things to do
I had crew when they stepped at a party
Hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson but it's restin' at home
In a shoe box  they see crews jock
So they wanna step and take the rep I got
I said  ""Wait a second""  check inside my coat for a shank
They must be imaginin' that I'm money in the bank
They'll get spanked
'Cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigger brothers waiting in the bushes to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk  never silence
Violence erupts when I clown ya  catch a beat down ya
'Cause I never back away from niggas
Even if you gotta pistol  I dare ya pull the trigger
But that's suicide  either you must die or I must so why bust me
'Cause I'm guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm  out in a hurry  a pow and a flurry
Of bullets come speedin' by  I needn't die
I gotta make tracks and take back my words
I eat 'em 'cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em...

Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
(At the wrong time)
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time

When I'm out on the town  I don't frown
At people cause they tend to get offended
And then the heat will
Be on my ass I got class
Never out of line  'cause
I'm standing here without a nine
Pistols I wish will not blast me
Task be  circlin' corners lookin' for Warners
You know  the Brothers  me and you
We didn't do shit but we get hassled because we crew
And we rollin'
This is my car  it isn't stolen
I hope you catch a slug  straight in your colon
When ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet
Fuck this law shit
But there's two laws to follow  you know
There is the laws of the city and the laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
Just in case niggas look and wanna wild in the place
'Cause of jealousy  well  it's me  only me
Niggas walkin' in poppin' shit  that's who the phonies be
Peep it one night and you'll see it it's quite clear

Damn  I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
Always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
Peep  I smoke weed get weeded
'Cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
They wanna cram my ass in the slammer
Punk po-po
Bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me
Punk mutt fetch me
Stretched me out at Customs  gotta bust 'em
I can't call it
They found it in my wallet
Now Customs got me and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone
Dog lookin' at me like 'feed me a bone'
He might bite me  very likely
They had to strike me with a fine or time
I said “Fine!”
Mines was 500 bones
For a gram of hash  my mind was blown
Come back to Michigan  so we can bitch again
Federal offense  now I better go and convince the judge...

Yo  we got a patient in the front
That's ahhh... suffering from an oversized gluteus maximus
And she wanna know can you solve it...

Mistadobalina is a jack-ass  much like a donkey
And I'mma pin the tale on the funky
Has anybody seen Del's head swell?
Cause I get paid well  kickin' much tail
Drink me a forty as I ride my rhinoceros
You don't like it? Well you gots to kiss
Where the sun don't shine  something like my behind
I lose a fan but I'mma be fine
Dr. Feelgood  didn't think I still could
Make funk real good
Take it then I looped it
Make you say - Gloryhallastoopid
The Motorbooty make you shake your rump
To the brand new D-Funk
Take a chunk cause I'm much like a hunk
To the dark skinned girls with funk in they trunk
Coming from around the way
It's Del better known as Dr. Bombay

Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away
(sing it  sing it  sing it)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(It's  so  funky)

Large as a black woman's gluteus maximus
And the question everybody's asking us
""Where'd you get your funk from?""
A brother named George and some 151's
So Let's Take It To the Stage you suckers
I jam  and Mistadobalina eats Smuckers
Back in the house with the crew Hieroglyphics
Now you know everything is terrific
Funk in the 1990's that's ironic
So grab you a sack of that chronic
Down with Da Lench Mob straight from the ghetto
But I'm under the sun in the meadow
Me and this Amazon sittin' on my lap
Butt so big when she walk it clap
Doin' the hoochie coochie in the forest
Y'all know who I am so girls sing the chorus

Watch your wife  cause if your spouse calls
Del's gonna damn sure make a house call (hello?)
You peeped out my drawers on your fence
I'm a dog  so you might see paw prints (woof)
(Whattup Doc?) Wait  it ain't cool to jock
Cause you're real far from a ballerina
So ohhh ohhh  Mistadobalina
Freeze  and get up off your knees
Everything that Dr. Bombay say
Is guaranteed to make your day
So ""oops"" upside your head
I like Club Med hangin' out with the dreads
And girl if you ain't got a germ
I won't hesitate to pull out my Funky Worm
But if you ain't down with Delvon
Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on (see-ya)
Cause I won't have fraudulent foes
Under my nose  if you won't eighty-six the clothes
Get out the way  so I can save the day
Cause I'm Dr. Bombay

He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline

She was going way too fast
Before she knew it  she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray

I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer  but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines  I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah  my heart might be breaking
But  this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinking alone  together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh  we should be drinking alone (Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh)
We should be drinking alone  together (Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh)

I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But  I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby  just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely  don't mean that we should

We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger

And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone

Drinking alone  drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)

All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed  something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh  she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby  why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever  now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying  he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said  ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul  and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh  and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby  why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?

Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go  check this shit  yo

I grew up on the crime side  the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands  Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth  yo  rockin' the gold tooth  'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this  son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better  same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's  every week we made forty G's
Yo  nigga  respect mine  or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!

Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all

It's been twenty-two long hard years  I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin'  but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such  who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short  now I face incarceration
Pacin'  goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus  forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base  smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed  and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids  corrupt cops  and crack rocks
And stray shots  all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild  smokin' sess  drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now  but yo  it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all

Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through  know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up  you gotta get over  straight up and down

Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM  get the money
Dollar dollar bill  y'all"

DJ: ""Whatchu wanna hear?""
C: ""I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint.""
DJ: ""Wu-Tang again?""
C: ""Ah  yeah  again and again.""

I smoke on the mic like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hell-raiser  raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh  tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get ya flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger  code red  danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal  too hot to handle
You battle  you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck  Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel  I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild  sit back  relax  won't smile
Rae got it goin' on  pal  call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project  then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip  go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more  I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot  akh

It's the Method Man  for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left  aah!
And set it off  get it off  let it off like a gat
I wanna break full  cock me back
Small change  they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over  but they don't know no better
But I do  true  can I get a ""suue""
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean O  yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off  because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

Ooh  what  grab my nut  get screwed
Oww  here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the ""suuuuue""
Yeah  yeah  yeah
C'mon  baby baby  c'mon  baby baby
C'mon  baby baby  c'mon
Yo  you best protect ya neck

First things first  man  you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center  you enter the winter
Straight up and down  that shit is packed jam
You can't slam  don't let me get fool on him  man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash  ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style  I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

For cryin' out loud  my style is wild  so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again  catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats  if rap was a gun  you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is  you're fuckin' with pros  and there it goes

Yo  chill with the feedback  black  we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock  ho  where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile  wearing Aeropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll  then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus  ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums  we'll be
Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah  another one dare  G-Gka-Genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors  they're scared to death to pump these
First of all  who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact  bring out the girls  and let's have a mud fight

You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck"

What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever  motherfuckers
This like  this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79

I bomb atomically  Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery  possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun  explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold  sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets  Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen  tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight  incite a war
Chicks hit the floor  die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier  control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow  swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked  performing live on your hottest block

As the world turns  I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence  the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire  transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back
In the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me  where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot
And blow spots  you want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart  tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks  certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking  tell your story walking
Take cover kid  what? Run for your brother  kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme  your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect  arts and crafts  paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

The saga continues
Wu-Tang  Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming  we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory  the agony of defeat
We crush slow  flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh  conquer  it's war
Allow us to escape Hell  globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie  vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk  squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom  tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra  graceful  music ballerinas
My music Sicily  rich California smell
An axe kill adventure  paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing  sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon  rotating ring kings

March of the wooden soldiers  C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in  not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation

War of the masses  the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls  engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray  niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle  the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo yo yo  fuck that  look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend  bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces  scum of the slum  I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing  thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston  get fly permission
Hold the fuck up  I'll unfasten your wig  bad luck
I humiliate  separate the English from the Dutch
It's me  black Noble Drew Ali  came in threes
We like the Genovese  sazon season these degrees
It's Earth  93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence  the wave burst  split the megahertz

Aiyo that's amazing  gun in your mouth talk  verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer  Blue-Tang  all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor  word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage  delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean  see y'all  the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor  Lex  the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel  play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly  undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland"

You must think first before you move

Raw I'ma give it to ya  with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation

Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force  my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Well  I'm a sire  I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum  and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin'  stressin'  contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed  it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain  there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin'  there's no survivin'

Rough like Timberland wear  yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks  all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads  braids  blow this hook

Rappinin' is what's happenin'

At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!

On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged  tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style  mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night  yo  I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out  and crazy
Strapped for nonsense  after me became lazy
Yo  nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs  I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs

Start flippin' and trippin'  niggas is jettin'  I'm lickin' off  son

Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide  when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie  paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender

Set it on the microphone  and competition get blown

A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site  now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart attacks
Niggas try to flip  tell me  who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism  make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it  so fuck it  come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream  I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' 'caine? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian  it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette

Ignorant and mad young  wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah  my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy  real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one  yo  growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina  yo  no doubt  the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up  better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends  they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North  now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes  I'm not playin'  get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke

I pointed a gat at his mother's knot

Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots  havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall  my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp  I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight  gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed  be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo  mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away  I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo  I can't cope with the pressure  settlin' for lesser

It's self-explanatory  Genius  word

He the head  let's put it that way

Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?

Domination  baby  fuck that

Moe said he'll go first  I said I'll take next
Here  take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
He seemed to ignore  I said  ""Be for real!
She's not even worth it to go raw deal.""
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by  Moe  I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up  I am airin' out
Hey yo  he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie  like a Whammy  he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P
Ain't nothin' wrong  but he got caught with the H.I.V
Now no life to live  doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears

After laughter comes tears"

It's the jump off  so just jump off my nigga

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

Ha  holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse  off course (off course)
Follow me  Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio  blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill  the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel  who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease  and elbow room
Baby play me  baby fall down  go boom
Party people gather round  count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin Hot Nicks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin  smokin  hopin
I don't croakin  from overdosin
Hey  kid  walk straight  master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open)  let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: ""I'll fuck yo' ass up!""
Now listen

Back  back and forth and forth

E with the English  extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin  and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae  chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks  rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest  Las Vegas  paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos  Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo  ex three bangos
Bancos  stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those  bang those  same old  same old

Yeah y'all  straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit  word up represent  rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style  killers  y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing  get up on that shit right now boo  do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

Yo  step to my groove  move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec  grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing  shaking all sets  and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets  move all best  who want the dram' next
You all stank  we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real  while you crank
Slide  do or die  fry to bake
Admire the greats  on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark  every part I take  heavy darts that quake
It's okay  all fakes  get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill  yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go  check the flow  saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick  hold the gossip  stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling blocks to lead me around

Yakub  maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever.

Struck a match to the underground  industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come  try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically  that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions  throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from  getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall  formed a mural
He took a look  saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired  dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk  tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk  your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk  I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black  you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop  my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus  making no fuss  I got self love
Unglove the noose  watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse  heavy at the booze
I don't walk  I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall  looking properly
But comely  I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers

Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng root  I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled  the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us

Is it appetite for destruction?
Slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something  trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun  busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage  the sickest flow

To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant

For all my peoples incarcerated  for those who ain't make it

Yo  in the housing  thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways  memories stays engraved
All my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger  blind to these lies  they die younger
In this New World  the Order slaughter men  women  and children
Ten feet gates surround the building  keep us sealed in
The projects  lifeless like a Vietnam vet
Constant war  sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle  can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts  Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage  lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring  I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase  performin' a sting
It's hard to keep control  I bless those who seek a scroll
Tryin' to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model  I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told  some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold  and they eventually sold
Their life and times  deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute  the scientist mind

You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads to skin irritations
Babies being born with disfigurations  experimentations
On their faces  there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain
Screams of terror are hidden by the passin' trains
This can't be little Hussein  his uncle cries
As he drops to his nephew's side  holdin' his cane
Just give me a name
Of who has inflicted this bitter sickness  and left us to witness

Yeah  yo  curses from war  innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways  hands  solemn in praise
Tree of life  more precious than rubies  golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit  Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
While we die  hard-livin' people whine about religion  vision
Blow  spin  and sin and killing what's revealin'
It's a never endin' battle with no endin' or beginnin'  listen
Zero process  progress  become the hunted
America's most wanted  good life  flaunt it  want it
Some love the speed  some satisfy a need
Some want to be down  young gun seed  jungle breed
The strong must feed  someone die  someone bleed
One flew astray  and it caught my little seed
Can it be? The ice savage  trife life  made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes  pipes
Take in my energy  breath and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Y'all bitches love dances  and pullin' down your pants
While your man's on tour  your spendin' up his advances
Your friends ain't shit  all they do is drink  smoke  and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs  one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old  shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinkin'  pussy stinkin'
Fuckin' so much your ass and titties start shrinkin'
New World Order slave trade  minimum wage  Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays?
Inside my lab  I'm goin' mad
Took two drags off the blunts  and started breakin' down the flag
The blue is for the Crips  the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops  and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night  by the dawn early light
Why is sons fightin' for the stripe?

As we dwell through this concrete hell  callin' it home
Mama say  ""Take your time  young man  and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searchin"" for them glory days he never had""
So many bad want to scheme for American dream  no more kings
The cash rule everythin' now  we goin' down
These babies lookin' up to us  it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's  get on the bus
But envy  greed  lust  and hate separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer  brothers  we unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel  killin' each other

You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away

GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!

Champion gear that I rock  you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN
As I come and freaks the sound  hardcore
But giving you more and more  like ding!
Nah shorty  get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack  flippin what  murder one  phat tracks
A'ight? I kick it like a Night Flite!
Word life  I get that ass raw  I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from Bedrock  cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound  we going to war right now
So  yo  bombin
We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save ya breath before I vomit

I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger  plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey  yo  RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul  niggas save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho  this is MY show  tical
The FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do
I'm like a sniper  hyper off the ginseng root
PLO style  buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox

Yo  yeah  yo
I leave the mic in body bags  my rap style has
The force to leave you lost  like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material  made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker  Inspector  bad man
From the bad lands of the killer  rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare  get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
Now  lo and behold  another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode

Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track  and that's that
Rap assassin  fastin  quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox!
I'm hot  top notch  Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw  I'm rugged and raw! I repeat  if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me  you out of respect  chops ya neck
I get vexed  like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way  make way  yo! Open the cage
Peace  I'm out  jettin like a runaway slave

Ya gettin stripped from ya garments  boy  run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like falopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed  boy  Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag  Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful  plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil  I break strong winds up against your
Abbot  that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets  I gots to make the fabrics

Are uh-ah-uh Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurai
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress  shootin' that PISS!
Niggas be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb
I got funky fresh  like the old specialist
A carrier  messenger  bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied  and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE

My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya  slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa  Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over

Orange stars and green clovers"

 Yo  yo

Fusion of the five elements  to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate  livin' irrelevant
The most benevolent king  communicatin' through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted  Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere  throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere  thermosphere  stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea  everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth  crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through  third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes  robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe  babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes  then examinated
Blood contaminated  vaccinated  lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization  Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan  so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew  'cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom  consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

United Nations  gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural a capella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon  military bomb fest
We want sanitary food  planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels  keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind  elevate  stay behind
The sun gotta shine  keep on  cremate
The whole Babylon  times up  move on
Kings on your pawn  checkmate  no fakes
Supposed through the gate  case closed
Things get froze  when it comes time  chosen ones
Will holding guns  we take flight with no fright
And attack  never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son  we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown  by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind  we unified as one
Half of black folk  we half broke  smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt

For you to defeat  the Gods
Impossible  you can never defeat
The gods
Impossible
For you to defeat  the Gods

Call an ambulance  Jamie been shot  word to Kimmy
Don't go son  nigga you my motherfucking heart
Stay still son  don't move  just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January  your young God needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back  excuse me bitch  gimme your jack
One  seven one eight  nine one one  low battery  damn
Blood comin out his mouth  he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie  don't start that shit
Keep your head up  if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight  we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine  his father and mines  they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left  told me rock it with respect
I opened it  seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic  tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one  oh shit  here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on  screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw  kissed him
Rubbed his hair  turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats  Officer Lough  took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin  Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car  Dirty Tasha are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man  was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher  blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the Paul assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be  from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers  about to leave
Finally this closed chapter  comes to an end
He was announced  pronounced dead  y'all  at twelve ten

Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin  and we decreasing
So at the same time  when you play with guns
When you play with guns  son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own

Like you had the key (Like you had the key)
Cold snapped across your hands
Breaking in two  leaving in me

It’s north or south motherfuckers
Take a pick
Which one will you choose?
I am reluctant to move
'Cause there's nowhere to go between a rope and a railroad
Oh

The fault  the guilt
Look at the blood we spilt
Loneliness is a hell of a drug
And I can't get enough

Spirit breaker  do me a favour
Cut me open  let me see inside
I'm more than a man  but a mess of a lover
Cut me open and you'll understand

Tell me it's all in my head
Tell me it's all make believe
You gave too much that I had to leave
Spirit breaker  do me a favour
Go

I wished the best for you my dear
I wished the best"

Even when we’d argue  we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits  and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws  paranoia  and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices  that's hard to deny
After the storm  something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun  this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue  I'll never say it

And I bury hatchets  but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me  they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama  it loves me
And I can't let you go  your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor  it's like your body is gold

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez  Mexico
Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said  ""Willy Lee  your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
""Yes  oh yes  my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.""
When I was arrested I was dressed in black 
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said  ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""
Into the courtroom  my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes  in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read  in the first degree
I hollered  ""Lawdy  Lawdy  have mercy on me""
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pin
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Lay off that whisky  and let that cocaine be"

At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground

One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling  voices crying
Some are born and some are dying

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks

Till Armageddon no salam  no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still

Was before he left  he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well  he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya  life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well  I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well  it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table  dealing stud
Sat the dirty  mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well  I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well  I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down  but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you  I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son  this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it  he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me  and you got the right
To kill me now  and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me  before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa  and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him  now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son  I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone

Living in the hopeless  hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why  you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And  I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing  now it's all I got
We're one  but we're not the same
Well  we hurt each other  and we're doing it again

You say love is a temple  love a higher law
Love is a temple  love the higher law
You ask me to enter  but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love  one blood
One life  you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters  brothers
One life  but we're not the same
We get to carry each other  carry each other
One

If you were somewhere else  you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word  though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
Now the scaffold seemed high  and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd  but she shed not a tear

A box  under the bridge  like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us  fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that  face facts

Everybody people  everybody bleed  everybody need something
Everybody love  everybody know  how it go
Everybody people  everybody bleed  everybody need something
Everybody love  everybody know

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness  I'm with this
But on the real  I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717  black daddy  white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned  go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man  what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child  as a little boy  playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck  praise God  I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this  race that
I wish I could erase that  face facts

Everybody people  everybody bleed  everybody need something
Everybody love  everybody know  how it go
Everybody people  everybody bleed  everybody need something
Everybody love  everybody know

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh  it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act"

Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law  livin' how I'm livin'  fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup  drivin' through the sticks

Motivated  under-educated  and hated

Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is  and man  that'll break 'em
And bitch  I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck  back in that basement  not a dollar to my name

Little brother  this is yo' sister  you're busy  I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well  well  I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh  I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin'  I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately  it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I  I feel more and more like mommy  I know I’m me  but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better  but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser  I'm gone
And as for... oh no  he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen  cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart  that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard  I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me  that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure  I've been feeling under pressure

Hey  son  this is your father  don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town  but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya  where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel  come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way  I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real  I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean  no longer a fiend
Yeah  I'm 57  but I feel 19
And I love you I swear  Bobby  I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need  of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy  but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

Hey  what's up  bro? This Ralph  I didn't want much  man  just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh  Dad hit me up  it's his birthday today  but I know you know that.

Uh  yeah  dear family  I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant  my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin'  I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant  but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world  I started seein' another girl
It fell through  man  what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft  on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist  I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love  the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile  people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing  you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you  but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through  uh
We ain't spoken in a while  tell me sister  how yo' child?
Come now  girl  give me a smile  come on  girl  don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before  but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E  stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama  how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years  that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything  I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all  but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love  this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love  everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure  I've been feelin' under pressure

Hey  son  I'm sorry I missed your call today  but I was in an AA meeting. Um  a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you  you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore  um... Livin' on my own  you know  um... Anyway  the whole family  even the family that you don’t know  my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway  son  I love you  I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin'  you know? And um  I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)

Doing me good  that's what I thought at first
Me and you together  swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh  my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn  took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am  who will I be  where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king  who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go  I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong  can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go  I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you  Nikki
But I love it when I feed you  Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you

But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)

I wish I could erase you  you’re everywhere I go

Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave

We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

Yeah  in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens  everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album  what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted  this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather  the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people  if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level  the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now  it's forced upon me  different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big  but let's be honest man  it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets  y'all only see me on the street
And even then  that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world  I'd rather hide
That misconception  ""'Cause I rap  I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect  if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me  ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words  I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album  I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets  watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now  just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks  so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age  they buy the brand
There's ups and downs  don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God  he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life  but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt  we call that champagne

Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy  but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love  they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn  you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales  I'm just me  ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you got a fucking problem  bitch  I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach  I don't need a piece

So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side  always down to ride
Don't get it twisted  I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out  they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance  peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack  homie Castro  we dropping bars
It's all love  man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it  shooting for the stars
Yeah  I'm a born sinner  but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me  can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest  whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there  we got a feast  though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now  let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em  that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind  rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck  my mind-state celibate
Run quick  tell a bitch  rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz  my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor  murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis  decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra  yes  I gotcha  bitch it's Logic

Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him  I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him
I said  I really want to kill him—but I can't

Little Bobby  just a youngin’  skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble  my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare  food stamps  and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more  mama on drugs  daddy M.I.A

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes  I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes  despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y  I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy  number one—I better be
Bitch  I said  ""I bet I be.""
Take my kindness for weakness  trying to get the better of me
Tell me  how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me  talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans they say they love you
But they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want
How they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs  now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge  I could do it  bitch  I run it
Worldwide tours  type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry
'Bout bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger
And better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me
They tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop  and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give?
This is feelings on the page  know my wisdom  not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions
That shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated  but all equal
To know the ending  one must understand the prequel  uh

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes  I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

Spit it like Holy water
Prophetically repent 'em  then we gone"

Rub a dub  if your bitch bad  we might hit your girl

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is  your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed  and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest  according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man  we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well  Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit  at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no  man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now  his final one

One  two  three  four
One  two  three  four  listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact  I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance  my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home  destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment  I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas  Cole  and Hov
Eyes closed  I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit  you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams  fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace  so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood  need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga  my advice  fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are  identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system  then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion  only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true  but at the same time  I'll never be you
And you'll never be me  no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now  you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers  that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God  learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone  acceptance"

Said  she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car  I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time  I'm not buying
If it's anybody else  wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday  if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone  all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well  this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart  it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way  boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell  this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you"

Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I want to go home
I need to go home

Maybe surrounded by
Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I want to go home
God I miss you  you know
I can close my eyes and see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same

Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I want to go home
I need to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
And I want to go home


Now the reasons I'm so far away aren’t good enough
Whatever they need me for
I know that I need you more
So I'll do the things I got to do to get back to you
I need you to believe
I'll make it back by Christmas Eve

Another Christmas day will come and go away
And I won’t leave you alone
No  I'm going to go home
I'm going to be home
Though I'm surrounded by
This cold December night
I feel so alone
I'm going to go home
Babe  I miss you you know

Let me go home
I've had my run baby I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright
When I'm holding you tight
Cause this Christmas I'm home"

Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses  sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear  oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses  sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear  oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses  sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear  oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

Yeah  I like doing what she likes
Hmm  yeah"

Oh - man  it's like...
It's beautiful how this all started  you know?
But uh... I'm'a just break this shit down for you real quick
Yeah  check
Yo!

I'm just spittin'  livin'  revealin' what I do
Roll with the family every time I step up to venues
I gotta pursue  have deadlines to meet
And gotta finish 'em before the late night creeps
The words I speak over beats never sleep  or never egotistical
Never cliche or stereotypical - from the heart
Whether it's concept or rhyme
I rub it in leave you feeling warm all at the same time
Ash it out on you broads but this ain't Escobar
It's G-baby Gavlyn  Gavlish or Gav-Nasty
Whatever cheesy alias you wanna call me
You get the point  get the picture
Read my lips  catch my drift
Your girl was born with a gift but I'm humble as well
Only five feet tall but rising high as hell
With acrylic nails and a white blouse to match
Reekin' like a weed stash who would have knew
(This is what I do)

Uplift your body and spirit
Bump the beats loud so you could hear it
Sooth your mind every time you hear me rhyme from line to line
Recognize I'm not trying to be the lyrical champion
Just your ordinary MC
Let you know music is what I do and breathe
Anybody bite the steeze foot to the teeth
'Cuz these lyrics are my love and I don't take them lightly

So who's rapping now? Cause nowadays that's the new style
But listen to the rappers that influencing these juveniles
How can this happen to something so true?
But it's been said the ongoing saga continues
Let me preview a little piece of myself
I'm a nicotine feind with needs don't like my weed with seeds
Rather compromise than disagree
Cause I understand the position of your two feet
Forget making enemies  but that's just me
Some cats are difficult - Inch under your senses and enhance your temple
But I'm able to blow your ass back
Cause I'm not tryna be skimpy in these raps
Perhaps  you should take a second while the record's spinning
What is it that you're saying? Are your beats just banging?
Well  whatever it is I give you the biz'  influence these kids
To get your hands up to some real Hip-Hop shit

Like some other men do
Get out of here
Get me some money too

See  I got these dudes callin' me every damn day
Even if they married  got a family  the whole shi-bang
They still come my way  and they like to buy me shit
Thinkin' i'mma take you serious  come on now  dick
I don't get aroused by cheating and a fatherless kid
You're as faithful as it is  i'mma play with your mind
Let you think your trick ways is gonna get you some alone time
That ain't gonna happen soon cause by noon
I'm on your last buck  and you're prayin for luck  for my trust
But it's a must that I turn you down
You're persistent  you like to stick around
I like to use you and still treat you like a clown cause you're no good
Thinkin' i'mma give in to those lies
And those pretty eyes but you still crooked on the side
So go get me some dough  cause yo  i'm runnin' low
Just leave it on the table and walk out the front door

I fuck with his head if he tries to fuck with mine
Alot of cats is tryna' play me  this shit is gettin' outta line
Thinkin' i'm clueless of what you're tryna' pursue
I can tell by the topics that you choose
Slidin' me drinks  hopin' i'mma get loose
But the only thing i'm lost on  is your sorry ass game
Although  not every man is the same
But for some damn reason i'm a magnet for these lames
They have no motivation  this scumbag type
Thinkin' they slick in conversation  only lookin' to pipe
But dude  i'm alright  I know you kinda' don't think you'll ever find
The time to let you into some o' mine... and that's it
No point in taking this further  ""no"" is the answer
Should've realized as soon ???
Hell nah  you'll never get my number
You got alot of nerve just thinkin' I would touch ya"

You might speak a different language but I see you observe
You have a good soul  and the chemistry is nice
You sugar coat a lot  since we off to be exact
Repress a lot of anger and I'm always holding back
But I'm not losing sleep  the memory I keep
Honestly it's not worth my time  I swear not a second
I see you get excited and it gets me kind of frightened
You don't know what you're doing man  you're stepping on my toes
Blindly  remind me  what makes you think you can't wait ?
Everybody lost their mind and their sense of respect
Been nice for too long  now I feel with regrets
Panic attack  fuck I need to breath
Smoke this weed  leave the room away from the energy
I'm not tryna consume  you feel me hen ?
And jealousy never made me feel better  really
I'm filled with gratitude  though I'm in tunnel vision  steady working
Let the meaning happen when I'm not searching
Just know you destined  and lay it on the table
Not everybody's straight up  but everybody's able...to be

Feel the need to succeed
Holy innocence  it's a childhood dream
I know it's not what it seems
But I love a guilty pleasure  uh  a guilty pleasure
You feel the need to succeed
Feel the need to succeed
Holy innocence  it's a childhood dream
I know it's not what it seems
But I love a guilty pleasure  that's all I could say

I'm made of glass  I crack fast
I seek your soft skin  the moment that we're in
It's the past  let's begin  why pretend
No matter how it ends  still want you in my life as a friend
Fuck it though  I'm better off alone
To be the bigger person is depressing  I don't know
I try to make sense  but why do that ? I'd rather black out
Forget it all  as a matter of fact
...Uh  eyes hurt from the flashback
Do it again  just a recap
I learned a lesson  I have an obsession with the wrong situation
Always thinking I could fix
But so far  no one seems to be convinced
Lost that train of thought when I was walking off that cliff
Or should I say slipped  jumped  or pushed  is it suicide handbook ?
Nah let's take a second  look
Love to tell you what you shouldn't hear  dysfunctional and weird
You're soma comfortable and the point is never clear
The way it's gonna stay  don't try to perceive
Cause you're only gonna hate me once you understand...me"

Yeah  yeah  yeah
Quick to say the obvious when this is preposterous
Don't care about the awkwardness  I know it all too well
The attention makes me hibernate but I've learned to tolerate
Fear with love but I carry hate

No  I doubt it. And it's better off that you don't
He's conceited  I can tell so imma slit his fucking throat
Wait I'm too angry got problems
Have you noticed? Just stuck in 
Alone with my thoughts come and bury me  socialize only musically
Most likely gonna have you fooled  sad to say but kinda true
And I'm the one still growing up  relevant who gives a fuck
I'm that bitch  I wish you would
More gossip on the topic  wasting time come on now drop it
Where's your head at? And why you asking questions?
This simply a distemper  out the womb you steppin'
Asking for handout cause I'm gettin' recognition (not this again)

Ok  I see you
Little buster
Fuck this shit I'm down to ride
Only one thing on my mind
Surviving at all cause it's taken too high
Like all the time
I guess the drugs I misuse
So quick to help my issues
Wait. Who really knows at the moment?
Like all the time
Like all the time
Only one thing on my mind
Like all the time
Like all the time
Only one thing on my mind
I want that brand new shit  shifting in baby steps
Discussion  interruption  only listen cause I overslept
What's the point of saving  lost the craving to the specialty
In the reality your loyalty not done respectfully
Easy for me to see more than you think
Where you coming from?
What goes up must go down  and another one
Subconscious makes me nauseous  tell my sis we gotta be cautious
Independent something sacred
Seen all the bullshit  bet we made it
And that ain't compare to the problems we shared and the bullshit that we facing
Wait  hold up. Take it
Kinda makes you wanna break shit
At a loss just like my patience  and I'm lost because I'm anxious
Have the rawest because my placement came along with so much hatred
Stuck between a rock and a hard place  tied up like an arm race
Light up like a car chase

And it's that Clarity (2x)

When I'm able to maintain
With this word play each and every day
Some say its a phase
But I say its a way of life
Which is why when I grip the mic
I grip the mic tight
Looking at my shadow from another street light
Getting tired of the bullshit
Talk is cheap
Yup I meant it when I said it
Cuz cats now a days people are too hard headed(?)

What is hip-hop to me?
Rythm
Base with the kick  I pump a drink
Come in this choacher as a female
Just speaking with detail
Can't catch up to my pases when I shake this
Why I leaving no trace
What would reaction be
Without an action?
What would Gavlyn be
Without a passion?
What would a painting be
Without the vision?
What would a story be
Without the description?
Just doing me
Doing my thing
As I bring
As your ordinary talent
Cuz when I kick I got balance
And what I live is what I give
It's logic
Take a look at my profile
From my sense of style
Haven't felt this way in a while
Label myself as G
But when I say G
I mean genuine  feminine

My music is for everybody
With the it-shit
Talking or just telling stories
But I'm about to unfold
To shit untold
How do you walk away from a person
When their emotions molds?
Like damn
Man the ball is in your court
If you miss the shot
Walk away and be a good sport
And thats my motto
I'm not good at drama
So is with the ----?
Shit it's time to wake up
Regardless that life is tough
Or surrounded by cats
You can trust  or peeps
I just don't give a fuck
If you feel me
Throw it up  drink it up
Or my personal favorite
Light it up
Yeah  never settle for less
It's in the progress
It's all the process
Even though it seems like a mess
Just keep it up and
Feel the essence
When I place this
Smooth rhymes
That makes you wanna caress yourself
Its Gavlyn bitch  who else?
Why'd you put your girl next to me
If she can't flip the scale?
Not trying to be a buzz kill
Shit  I'm just being real
I'm not cocky I'm convinced
Check the difference
Feel the wind blowing
As I'm rapping the circumference
Keep the joe burning
And keep the flow gowing
And watch your mind open
Concept
No Teachy-k-teach
No preachy-k-preach
The only way to hear it
Is to hear it from me
G.A.V
Pissing on M.C's
Chicks hate me cuz their men
Be throwing their chonies (?) at me
Yo  mad cast say I have potential
Others say I need to get better on the mental
Still gonna build my style
That's for sure
Still gonna keep these rhymes up top and pure

Getting used to how things we arrange

Still got my own definition of unique
When I speak  blending colors
Still make a masterpiece
Never stroke with my confidence at my feet
You can tell the years fly like a breeze
When you look at the leaves
Born and raised the melody
Everyday live  shit  and eat this poetry
Cause the only love of my life is the M.I.C
And lyrically  artistically
Had my word shell like abstract graffiti
So you could see me  hear me  feel me
You can keep an open mind
Cause Gav likes to keep an open mind

It's been a minute
How ya ladies doing nowadays I see y'all crushing

Yeah I was kicking it with JDS
Damn lately it's been crazy
The days just get a little hectic from
Remembering the times when shit was reckless
Ah but the hitters silent nowadays because they respect us

Yeah yeah we queens in this
Finesse like its nothing
I mean we really in this

That's right bitch

Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
Spittin' off this rap
Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
From the front to the back

The sun drop down
Driving up Vermont
What now
It's time to wrap it up on top huh how
How did this even happen
Not long ago I was even rapping
Just found an outlet to ease off of my habits
My paint was dripping off of that easel
And all the pain that had built up to point like a needle
I wrote my own book
And now I needed to read it
And whether I liked the outcome or not
I needed to see it
It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard for me
And anything would set out the alarm for me
Live too fast too soon too young to die quick (Gavlyn: die quick)
A couple times  I almost died shit
Then one day I woke up
Decided to take a cold cut
How much longer would I be able to hold up
I made a conscious decision
Affected my life
And how I went from 
To  the price
And now life's never been so ill
I always reflect on my past  present  and still
Five years ago I needed to kill
So I started ripping rhymes speaking my mind
I'm bleeding and still

Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
Spittin' off this rap
Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
From the front to the back


Time passes so fast
My beginning was supposed to make it impossible for me to be where I'm at
Shit was real different
Just a few years back {Vel: few years back}
Never thought I could get through all that
I had just moved back home to LA from Seattle
No car  rode the bus before I ever got to travel
Before I went overseas
Bittersweet memories
See sick fantasies
Can become reality
But I was hopeless
I'm broken
I'm lost
Just did two weeks in county
Now I'm out of a job
Arrested at my own show
What a scene (aw hell nah)
Said it then  I'll say it now homie
Fuck the police
Two racks to my name
Rent free at my granny's
And these promoters fucking with my money
Feeling bummy
Sick and tired
No desires no goals no ambition
Just an idea a vision
A small fan-base
I'mma make 'em listen
I'mma make 'em scream my name at a show
Throw my own events and direct my own videos
I'mma blow
It's crazy reminiscing
I reflect on my past and feel better about the present

Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
Spittin' off this rap
Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
From the front to the back

So what it be like 15 with a rap dream
Tryin' to break down schemes that's flowing in my bloodstream
Know just what they mean
And how they make me feel
And I'm not mad at how they maul me
Honestly it never felt more real
So where they at though
Put your fucking hands high
And light one for you and I
No I cannot lie
Five years ago all we did was try
And we out here hungry in the grind
Never die  still alive
And yo we never quitting
We stay living through the most
And if the lane different I ain't trippin
Love the moment that I am breathing
We steady moving
Don't see the purpose of any sleeping
We keep it pushing keep it fiending come on
Doing what I love and see the aftermath
Running through these chapters
I live them too fast
They say noones safe
But I'm built to last
Y'all scratching the surface
But yo I'm breaking glass

Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
Spittin' off this rap
Looking back
Yo all the way back
Where it's at
From the front to the back

Tiff
You gonna come in here

Come on in join the party

I used to be puzzled now I paint no mind
Just realizing giving a fuck is just a waste of time
Especially when it comes to rhymes or appearence
Fucking bigot bitch I call it how I feel it
And I feel you don't expect me
To get your hands on my eyes you see

Go ahead and touch the skills
Either believe or flew

Thankful for the blessings

When it was all so different right

Ain't never gonna turn to stone

Leave a voicemail at the tone

See them trying to reach me
Please believe me
Hear them loud and clear
Know just what they want
And yes I listen because I volunteer (right)
Yeah I volunteer twice
Like I'm in this shit for life
Since the moment we crossed eyes
Since the moment I've seen light in this shit and I thought to relate
No I never stopped
Never thought to debate
Hell yeah  hate
Only thing that kept me going is believing fate
You couldn't hold me back if you tried bitch
I'll cut you off like a side bitch
It's embedded in me like a nervous twitch
That I'll never switch because I got an itch
That will make you flinch
And once I get the pitch
That they try to ditch
Or go and flap they lips
Now they see my sitch
That I've found my niche

And we do what it takes to make it swing to L.A.  where my crew is
Never been sober I'm using
Simply bend backwards on my raps
Techniques  my mind stays loaded
Never   why sweat it

Uh huh  I got the key without the calibe
I’m thinking out the box  like I don’t know was shade
Now watch me formulate my words and concentrate
I like to speak with my hands or with my fingers
And when I let it out this shit gonna paint a picture
I’m a old soul in a modern world
I’m so oldschool without the jerry curls
See you can lace me up because I’m on my way out
You see what I’m about is really just a payout
Another grind  another hustle that’s it usually so DJ run it back
I does it beautifully just for you to see

Aye  my headspace  got me contemplating decisions of how I’m truly living
Oh  my headspace  got me looking at surroundings  feeling overcrowded will I leave I doubt it
Aye  my headspace  second guessing first impressions and what they really saying in a sentence
Oh  my headspace  got me preying to the universe with every bit of struggle
Man  it’s gotta work

Mama always told me I’m a Rolling Stone
She said you got a heart of gold  enjoy your growth
So every leap I take is not a leap of faith  it’s a leap of certainty
I truly made I like to see the bigger picture and the schemes
The visions of my dreams and what they really mean
This ring and all that life lets answer all the questions
And everything I mention not a secret weapon
It’s a peace mind a peace of openness
You need to have an open ear with closed lips
I love these imperfections like I’m clueless
And I see my happiness is on the hit list
Don’t try to come up on me quick man
It’s gonna happen never
The way I like to see it
You are the least of my endeavors
At any given time  at any given measure
Not stopping in my tracks  bruh
I’d apply the pressure

I'm shaking notice you're far from blind
I see you ignore it
It's so bold
It's growing a sense I'm in a friendzone quick
A second ago you were looking at my tits
And you touched my hips it was not accident
You want these curves
It's all yours
It's you I adore
But you close the door
I'm like before
Never too sure what it is
I'm gonna keep throwing them hips till you let me hit
See you fucking on white chicks  end up bored
You need a Latina to settle the score
With a strong mind
And seen how you grind
And doesn't even  your time
I leave you alone when you're in your zone
Beat your backbone  you slouch and stuff
Search your  you're not aware of such (whoa)
But I'm really wet I wanna feel your touch

Head over heels and still you misunderstand
I'll let you know if  when I need a friend
We gon' smoke but never hold my hand
I'll let you know if when i need a friend (yeah)

Still I'm the one that look like a douche bag
Or a nigga with his do-rag  (too tight)
Am I wrong because when you left
We still had booze left
Two grams of kush left
Now you goose-necking
What's that for
See I'm being disrespectful
And we ain't even nothing special (hey)
Every time we chat it's a group text
Every time we play it's a team sport
Never told you what this D do
Never asked you how that P work
And you bought a nigga shoes and shit
But I just thought that's because you were cool as shit
You're the only one with a whip
How you gonna trip now
Don't do that shit (don't do that shit)
In the meantime
The three-way was a green light
We was supposed to film it
Instead said this don't feel right
When you got real hype
And you more like the chill type
Not the type to catch feelings
Or at least that's what you said when we was building

Why hesitate when you got something to say
Keep it moving who cares if the cops invade  shit

Being free vibrations shooting straight to me
Cause I feel my conscience as well as my purpose
To highlight the streets with a capital G
I used to put my head down when people asked me to free style
But then I felt wrong cause I knew I could get it right
So say fuck it no hiding behind a mic
Don't strike a pose shit im blooming like a rose

Never lost in translation like Bill Murray
Im making sense with this and who is my witness
The man upstairs so my purpose stay lifted
And its all right here all you gotta do is listen
I maintain the main frame on what the game is missin
Some heart  some pride some motherfucking lyrics
The part in mind where rhymes are inventive
The past the future where ever you be headed

A day is on the rise
I’m opening doors  I wouldn’t usually find
Getting caught off guard  man that’s most of the time
But I can still rhyme a rhythm like depended on life
Enter the epidemic where is covered in lies and it’s even worse when they do it right to your eyes
Ego killing them and filling them with nothing but fright
And being humble ain't an option  won’t believe in the hype
That you did it on your own with no help on the side
But when they catch you off guard  were the truth unwinds
See there’s a thing called dignity  it’s meant for the wise
If you respect yourself  it will open your mind
Being thankful for gifts even simple advice
So take a look of your surroundings not only your pride
Stay driven on the road where the limits collide
Stay in your lane but remember who taught you to drive
(Isa)
What if you decide
What if there is  a line
What if  what if..... its  a lie
I've never seen eternity
What is in your heart
What is in your mind
Tell me
Tell me how you've never loved
If you're not here
Once you see

A gratitude is the one thing you’re missing dude
Appreciation  peace forget all over the nation
Taking shit for granted  it happens at the right
Don’t understand it
Take control of your mind  command it
Change the way you’re thinking  the results will be outstanding
I use to be an immature chick  didn’t give a fuck about shit or the roof over my head
Looking past the fact that I got reckless in bed
I was thrown on the streets at the age of 15
Didn’t realize then what “counting your blessings” really mean
It was like a bad dream
But then I woke up
It’s not what it seems
Now I really know it’s not about me
And every day I thank God for the air I breathe
Keep a smile on my face without the luxury
You love life more without the selfishness and greed

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so  yeah  I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said  ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""

How many of us  how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us  we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number  I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues  I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing  too
I'm a deadbeat cousin  I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine  now my tux is ruined
In town for a day  what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you  but what's sad  you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her  shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve  don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve  don't I?
Talked down on my name  throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way  dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes  took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas  then I'm finished  then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy  you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest  dawg  I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends  'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off  'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M.  callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like  ""What's up  fam? Hope you good""
You say  ""I'm good  I'm great "" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family  immediate or extended
Any argument  the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter  said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well  cutie  I like your bougie booty
Come  Erykah Badu-me—well  let's make a movie
Hell  you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes  connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's  4 in the morning  spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction  middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians  rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you  it's damaging for you  I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me  I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up  you're making him mad as fuck

I said baby  ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""

Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is

Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual  make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy  thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service  head service  I came in first place
The opportunity  the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community  I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these  moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released  she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah  G  I was all for it
She said  ""K-Lamar  you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary  scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please  baby  no more parties in L.A.

Friday night  tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds  passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs  somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks  man  you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em  really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens  she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry  this one's so jammin'
You know it  L.A.  it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time  the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin'  the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter  I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye  I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know  know I hate agents
I'm too black  I'm too vocal  I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit  that's the new fragrance
It's just me  I do it my way  bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys  some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans  I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees  cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade  I might slam
Pink fur  got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money  thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry  a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here  we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots  high speed  turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop  like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach  good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back  good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money  money  money)!
Big  big money (Money  money  money!)
And as far as real friends  tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop  you dirty motherfucker!

You still ain't did shit about the other one

I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah  going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah  I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying  ""Drizzy  tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show  it was a sell-out event
Oh  you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it  gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’\'d do for fame  what would you do for freedom?
Please  check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please  please do not let these niggas near me
Please  think before you come for the great one
Please  who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please  somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage  they gon'

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah  they want it back to back

Money on my mind  you should think the same
J's on  pinky ring  dogging these hoes  I need quarantine
In the same league  but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame  I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me  I said  ""Baby girl  fall in line""
Okay  made a million off a dinner fork  watch me switch it up
Walked in  ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work  I got that work  got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto  we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce  this that dressing
Givenchy  nigga  God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime  I'd be arrested(Tru)

I touched down in '86  knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit  nigga hated it
Damon Wayans  homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot  you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn  ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us  then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn  should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man  you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next  but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat  I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look  just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances  God damn!

Ho  shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated  it's simple
I got sexy ladies  a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time  man  I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit  that's old fashion
Nigga  see what I'm saying  no closed caption
I paint pics  see the shit  good sex  need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth  drink a fifth  load the nine
Leave you split  in the half  smoke a half  need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems  getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing  I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

Oh me  oh me  oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl  you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time  you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth  I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail  we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then  man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do"

You've been caught up
With them bitches  I don't get it  you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that  'cause...

I love me  I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you  what are you so afraid of?
Darling you  you give but you cannot take love

Yeah  I needed to hear that shit  I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting  I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me  these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money  pussy  vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad  speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down  girl that nigga's amazing
Well  fuck it  we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper  just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child  beautiful child  I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl  what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy  huh?

I love me  I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you  what are you so afraid of?
Darling you  you give but you cannot take love

Uh  thinking 'bout Texas  back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that  before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing  I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong  that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married  what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit  name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out  I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living  I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open  it's hard for you to ignore
But girl  what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy  huh?

I love me  I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you  what are you so afraid of?
Darling you  you give but you cannot take love

Oh Lord  know yourself  know your worth  nigga
My actions been louder than my words  nigga
How you so high  but still so down to Earth  nigga?
If niggas wanna do it  we can do it on they turf  nigga
Oh Lord  I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone  lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left  dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah  the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Who the fuck them niggas is  boy?
OVO  man  we really with the shits  boy

I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits  boy
Fuck all that ""Drake  you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah  I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV  I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough  I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man  it's 2008  I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio  every night  late night
Gotta watch that shit  don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord  got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it  we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis  nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit  they like  ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest  run Forrest  go Forrest""
Yeah  I mean you already wrote for us
Damn  nigga  what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord  who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am  they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that  I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson  man  I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100  nigga  real quick
Real quick  whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100  nigga  real quick
Real quick  real fuckin' quick  nigga

0 to 100  nigga  real quick
Real quick  real fuckin' quick  nigga


Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit  yeah

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you  you would be dissin' you  dawg
Damn  okay  from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout  no way to soften that
'Cause me  I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor  who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit  no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these  man  the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it  who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up  boy  you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin'  Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin'  OB droppin'  not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off  man  we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah  been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn  fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself  how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet  watch me catch up now  for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

You know  years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play  how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio  of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking  say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it  I don't even tint it  they should know who's in it
I'm authentic  real name  no gimmicks
No game  no scrimmage  I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates  they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn  bridges burn  you live and learn
With the ink I could murder  word to my nigga Irv
Yeah  I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov  that's my handle
My saint's Changó  light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know  I speak Spanish too  uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go  we leave a worldwide mess

Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings

My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh  last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil  Jesus grab the wheel


Yeah  uh
Look  fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie  they still be tryna lil bro me  dog
Like I should fall in line  like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man  I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel  I don't know  guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it""  it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time  she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later  I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know  it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah  I guess that's just who I became  dawg
Nothing was the same  dawg"

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where  tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel  and we never waited
I took her for sushi  she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go  told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up  girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn  is it the fall  time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call  there's albums to drop  there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell  we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room  confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl  is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah  hell yeah  hell yeah
Fuckin' right  fuckin' right  alright
And we say hell yeah  hell yeah  hell yeah
Fuckin' right  fuckin' right  alright

Uhh  so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air  so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch  if you wave  then I will surf you
I flew jet  she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session  she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill  she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did  but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn  she say this shit gon' catch up to me  I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit  sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises  I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon  had a fire conversation
But  interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom  confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl  is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah  hell yeah  hell yeah
Fuckin' right  fuckin' right  alright
And we say hell yeah  hell yeah  hell yeah
Fuckin' right  damn right  alright

Yeah  I went out  I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed  shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know  I'm delirious…

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway  and say…

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up  I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me  have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh  cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more

And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But  shit  it's all good
We threw a party  yeah  we threw a party
Bitches came over  yeah  we threw a party
I was just calling  ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me  please  don't have much to believe in
I need you right now  are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels  I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them  I won't say no names
After a while  girl  they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy  girl  I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well  I'm sorry.""

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me  have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said  ""You niggas crazy""

I hope no one heard that

We gonna be in some trouble  trouble"

When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

Look  I apologize  often womanize
Took for my child to be born  see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song  I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome "" you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone  pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me ” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me  I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time  you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

I apologize  our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me  I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised  I cried  I couldn't hold
I suck at love  I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over  what if you over my shit?

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth  the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should"

But if it don't  then y'all will swallow the truth  grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude  ludicrous  lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title  put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it  sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference  they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew  maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated  disputed  hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict  like you didn't experiment?
Nah  nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again  and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders  too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do  so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go  he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

What's on my mind at any given time of day

Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

I had to hustle  my back to the wall  ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint  not a cent
Gotta vent  lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent  bring dollars in
By the bodega  iron under my coat
Feelin' braver  durag wrappin' my waves up  pockets full of hope
Do not step to me  I'm awkward  I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me  I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor  thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much  only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics  raisin' my head to the sky
Big  I did it  multi before I die
No lie  just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See  I'm a poet to some  a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ  the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate  satanist  scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case  see  it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter  a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See  it's as easy as cake  simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons  take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water  no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful  delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube  motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers  ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

—renegade! Never been afraid to say

You'll never be enough  let's just keep it real  JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z  I mean  you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better  nigga  I know you do
But you gotta do better  boy  you owe it to Blue
You had no father  you had the armor
But you got a daughter  gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z  this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi  JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z  we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up  JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life  that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school  you lost your principles
I know people backstab you  I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint  this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him 20 million without blinkin'
He gave you 20 minutes on stage  fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy  you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest  imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin'  ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along  all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga  never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade  what it did to Boston
Nah  JAY-Z
Bye  JAY-Z"

Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing

Vogueing on these niggas  champagne on my breath  yes

Even my old fans like  ""Old man  just stop""
I could if I would  but I can't  I'm hot
And you blow  I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth  the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again  got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin  ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs  go through cribs  and other things
No sympathy for the king  huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me

You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah  I sampled your voice  you was usin' it wrong
You made it a hot line  I made it a hot song

Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

Fellow Americans  it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov  OH  H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C  Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain  that's right
Hov  OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters  ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me  ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do  take you back to the dude
With the Lexus  fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie  dog (oh shit)

Now before I finish  let me just say I did not come here to show out  did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember  when it hits the fan  brother  whether it's next year  ten years  twenty years from now  you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on  I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga  I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn  but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice  trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice  ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then  how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed  still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit  nigga  period
Check out my hat yo  peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo  I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go  you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man  you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me  so I'm gone

Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible  baby
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good dude  I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches  just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain  four and change  Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it  pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic  that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

On repeat  the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde  pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand  sayin'  ""Let me see that clip!""
Shopping sprees  pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit  you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor  but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine  I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick  let me see — that's it
It was the cheese  helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies  now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that  and I don't remember you

I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah  I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

A face of stone  was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault  how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit  I'm a man with pride  you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had  just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls  I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad  she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit  I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I know  I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

It's fucked up  girl"

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah  kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies  see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids  but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet  so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette  baby  let 'em eat cake

Bad times turn to good memories  smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me  smile
Good times never fade away  smile

Here's your friendly announcer

Far as draft picks  my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov  I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin'  I had to remind y'all again  huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides  traded pride  we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss  it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain  it’s a blessin'

Bad times turn to good memories  smile

Even if I'm not with you here today  smile
Good morn' or evening  friends

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me  that was nothin'  a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions  I have no ceilings
Ah  this that feelin'  I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah  I was born with a pair  playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay  he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie  want my own cake
In charge of my own fate  respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power  huh
So our music is ours  niggas own their own houses
Ours was  ""Fuck you  pay me""
Now it's  ""Fuck payin' me  I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh  blood diamonds drippin' with guilt  I still ain't trippin'
That's life  winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers  America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said  ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain  I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh  the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit  inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh  what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou  uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku  huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh  these that drugs  heron flow  I spaz on the stove
This is Hov  no flex zone  nigga  who lied to you?
Look  you a pedestrian  don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters  huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home  he in the church
When I heard you got booked  that shit hurt
Feel for you bro  we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado  yet  we deny
Black entrepreneurs  free enterprise
That's why it's a black market  that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me  heh
'Cause the more I reveal me  the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter  smile

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives  happy  but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them  no harm for me
But life is short  and it's time to be free
Love who you love  because life isn't guaranteed

But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about  ""What's the reasons?""

Bitch  better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut  'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread  so you can be livin' it up?
Shit  I part with nothin'  y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin'  never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins  I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'

Check 'em out now  big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man  Pimp C  and B-U-N B

Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops  my bad  that's ""my scenario""
No  I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time  every place  everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin'  they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book  you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous  so mad  you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland  let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real  it don't get no bigger  man
Don't trip  let's flip  gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man  fool!

Smokin' out  pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up  watch him fall
Nigga  I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin'  baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh  now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy  my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick  then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades  sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block  hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night  its egg shell white
I got so many grams  if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin'  spendin' cheese
With Bun B  Pimp C  and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up  Jigga Man: that's what's up!

You built this prison and buried the key

I’ve given up on giving in
Temptation mocks me from a distance
But I won’t let it  win
This thin façade could never last
Like a snake that sheds its skin
Illusions shatter like glass
The sceptic inside me believes what he knows
Cynically silent but with nothing to show
The devil beside me is whispering doubt in my ear
I’ll keep pretending not to hear

So here I am for what it’s worth
I spilled my blood against the earth
Just to see the world in colour (the world in colour)

Dead; left for dead and left to rot
A tainted memory  an empty afterthought
I’d lay my whole life on the line just to see this through
If it consumes me  let the script upon my tomb read:
I found my love and let it kill me

I found my love and let it  kill  me

“Beg and plead  your own ambition brought you to your knees
Beg and plead  you built this prison  and buried the key”

A momentary lapse  the colours fade to grey...
As if the world we knew was never meant to be...
I know I’ll pay for my mistakes
Just promise me you’ll take
Take my word and take my everything

So here I am for what it’s worth
I spilled my blood against the earth
Just to see the world in colour (the world in colour)
So give me all you came here for
Give me hell and give me war
I’ll be waiting for an answer

I found my love and let it kill  me"

Bloodshot  staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat  carrying a dead weight
Dead-set on living like tomorrow was to blame
And through these holes you'd see the blackest soul inside of me

Running circles  old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless  call me stuck in my ways

Bloodshot  staring with a blank gaze

Dry mouth  taste it like a cut vein
Blackout  it all ends the same

So stay away  stay away

Black clouds hover low like a curse

This world will chew you up and spit you out on your own (believe me)

To just to watch you sinking
I can't help thinking
Was there something holding you back?
What's the weight of the world on your back?
So long  you're sick of the gravity?
Is there someone telling you no?
Do you wander with nowhere to go?
What are you waiting  oh  what are you waiting for?
I'm reaching out please take my hand
The water is getting higher and I can't understand
Why I can't pull you in
Do you even care  do you even want me there?
We are the victims
Just like our parents taught us to be
Roots planted firmly but we feel so far from the tree
And still we cling to the past with an iron grip
As we all fall fast asleep
Dreaming of security
The chance to redefine
The years we wasted living on borrowed time
My will is spent  I used the very last drop
Trying to keep my head on straight enough
I know it hurts  it hurts to feel it all slip right past you
I just want to ask you
Was there something holding you back?
Have you had to cover your tracks
So long  you lost your identity?
Is there something dragging you down
Crippled under the weight of the crown
What are you waiting  oh  what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for?
I'm reaching out please take my hand
The water is getting higher and I can't understand
Why I can't pull you in
Do you even care  do you even want me there?
For all of our differences
I always said I'd be there if you should come undone
It took all I had in me
Do you even care  do you even want me there?
(Do you even want me there?)
There are ghosts in every window
And they'll follow you back home
But if you stay a moment
I can tell you all I know
Of how these times have changed us
How they bring us to our knees
How they send us down the crooked path
Divide us temporarily
I'm reaching out please take my hand
The water is getting higher and I can't understand
Why I can't pull you in
Do you even care  do you even want me there?

Before we felt desire’s sting
We were content with what we had
And never wanted for anything

We  know  it’s futile to compare
Our culture was the culprit  we were taken unaware

Manifest the weakness  a self-fulfilling prophecy
Undermining every insecurity

It’s a fear growing deeper when no one’s around
Like a nagging aching sore
The devil’s in the detail  the truth inconsequential
The idle mind is scrutinized and robbed of its potential in time
Begging for redemption
Pleading for solutions

We know we never should have had this cross to bear
Our culture was the culprit  we were taken unaware

We’ve been led to think we needed more
Resenting who we are
Only to find that we were better off  better off before
Before we bought what we were sold
Before we tried to fit the mold
We’ve been chasing false perfection
Searching in the wrong direction
This is the crux of our corruption
Drawn into social seduction

Manifest the weakness  a self-fulfilling prophecy
Undermining every insecurity

To reinforce the fear that taught us that we’re never good enough

For some small peace of mind

Knowing how karma's cold hand grips at your throat?

Left in the dark  in blackest oblivion
Only forced me to learn that light comes from within
And only fades where fear prevails
Where is your heart?
Does it grow weaker each time you think of those you scorned from afar?
Their voices rise from the wreck to call you by name
The blood that tarnished the brush will mark us the same

Yeah  ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy  made friends with the floor
Two for one  you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet  you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle  made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club  tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go  go  go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row  row  row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew  chew  chew  'cause they hope I choke

Don't need a report  don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones
I wear the hat and I wear the pants
I am advanced  so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo  don't be mad 'cause you had the chance

Drop  say I took it and I ran for it
I won it  then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright  let them put a tan on it
Say I took it and I ran for it

'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her  I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops  I said  ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say  ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

Ayo  Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there  homie
(Ayy  ayy  ayy  ayy  ayy  ayy)
Let's go!

'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away  get away  get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See  they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come  a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go  and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow  and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter  'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom  a ba-da-bing  I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul  a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go  don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it  take it to another place
Gotta taste it  and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne  better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Look at me now  look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh)  look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

Man  fuck these bitch-ass niggas  how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi  I'm a nuisance
I go stupid  I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi  I'm the shit  no  I'm pollution  no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi  pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar  dressed like a skater
Got a big house  came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin'  fuck it  tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em  and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit  then I'm like  ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say  so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag  and my flag red
I'm out of my head  bitch  I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb  you ain't hotter than mine
Nope  not on my time  and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin'  slime? Nothin'  five
And if they trippin'  fuck 'em  five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch  I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right  and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice  and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while  I was like  ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down  I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes  look at me now  bitch!

Look at me now  look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh)  look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

Okay
Okay
Is that right?

If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true  but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle  it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh  I don't need your pity

Don't check on me
Oh  don't check on me
If we're not together  then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low  we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on  and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

You can't kill a flame with gasoline

You gonna start asking me questions like
""Was she attractive? Was she an actress?""
Baby  the fact is

You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry  making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy  saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful  so baby

Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb

Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live  we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else  somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me

I'm not ahead of my time  I just drew the first breath
If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me

Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest

My Dahlia bathed in possession  she is home to me

It's now or never she is coming home  forever

My plaid past  my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit  that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked  gotta get duked  the duke
Everybody hit the floor  we through the roof
Like a chimney  I commend me
How come it be  some lame ass nigga talking about
""Ah  he don't rap enough""
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like ""Wrap it up  hoe""
You ain't Scarface  you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick  you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfuckin' momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
Keep sleeping on me  I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime  I swear  I promise
Dare a nigga say something  tear a nigga face off
How come Blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white  know y'all can taste all this
Fly shit  I stay finna take off

I used to care what people thought  but now I care more
I mean  nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore  I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it  so insecure  no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame  we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine  or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone  whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs  got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go  Emily  Fam  and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk  at least I think so  can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear  they're not here
'Cause they don't care  it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins  I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping  I'm glad that it happened  I mean it
Between us  I think there's something special  and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand  even if you don't understand  hol' up

No matter what you say or what you do (No  no)
When I'm alone  I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas  I'll be right by your side

Turn your phone over  when it's all over
No settling down  my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling  you start crying
I come over  I'm inside you
I can't find you  the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""

But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid  so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time  but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome  good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers  but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong  but would you have listened to you?
Uh  you were crazy
I got a heart  but the artichoke

I'm a jerk  but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool  he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had  face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money  then you burn me  then you made off
She ain't a killer  but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering  ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo  fuck this

Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?

Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay  and oh

I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die

So I guess it all depends
On Oakland  on Oakland
And I'm nervous  truth be told

It would probably start a riot

Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me  I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me  weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July  house in Kauai  yeah we can try
So let's try

Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me  just hit me
And if I left you all alone  would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy  you miss me

Girl  what's your problem
Cause I know it's hard sometimes  baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl  we can solve them

Oh honey now girl  give it one night
If you just give it a chance  loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No  no  no...

And now that it's over  I'll never be sober

Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor  no papers

I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday  monotonous  Lost God  never pray
Forgotten us  lost love  never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it

We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open  we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway  the manager pissed as hell
I mean  where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena  but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina  30 dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo (I nuzzled my Nyla)
Then she said  ""You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago  sing me a different song.""
Whether you're trolling or controlling  just a reminder
You think you get it  you don't  it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—Now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell  just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden  this burden hurting  they said there was curtains
Certain demise  look in his eyes  the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love  saying  ""Go hard""
Making dope  it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams  so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; ""It's the best "" no  that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest  I vaporized
High on my own  it took time to realize
Because the internet  mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey  at least we're together
Man  I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself  people who needed my help
Feelings I felt  killing myself  no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information  retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation  your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication  but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met  doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it  where are you?
Who is this? Who is this) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game  but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever  my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance  my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence  first-person shooter
First person to move  first person to speak
My mils aren't meek  they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference  these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny  the day you born  that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner  we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face  but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit  becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening  she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith  she getting hers
Niggas take her props  like a musical  live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time  I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams  on the moon  I visit her
Every night I text her: ""I wanna solve the world  I think I need your help""
She text me  ""How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though  .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll  dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: ""You see what these labels do to me?""
Text said  ""I'm wet""; I said  ""Hold up  wait a minute""
H2O plus my D  that's my hood  I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling  never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit  fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit  but act like it don't stink
We were childish  but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit  eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies  I'm afraid to go nuts
""Life: The Biggest Troll""  but the joke is on us
Yeah  the joke's you showed up

This is on a bus back from camp
I’m thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn’t met yet  running around all summer  getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me
You’ve never said  so I haven’t been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who’s smart and funny and who  if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won’t go to the same high school
So  this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I’m like  “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I’m telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there’s no expression on it
And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny”
I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter
Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say  “okay”
I don’t know exactly what you mean by it  but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus
So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long  I really am
I wake up  the bus isn’t moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you’re not there
Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore
We’re parked at the pick-up point  which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row  on our way off
It’s Michelle  a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light  so I can’t really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn’t know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer  even though there’s two weeks until school starts
This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not
I’m just saying it’s what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man  make it all for everybody  always
Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody  everybody already knows  I told them
But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical  hardened  and mature and shit
But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven’t"

Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other  I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch  I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame  they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding  stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow  she still look good though
Love is Eastside  who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10  but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great
Hotel penthouse  gon' and let it ruminate
City never sleeps  so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could  then I kept going

Are you ready to cry? 'Cause I'm no good  no good
Ooh  girl  I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this  I'm tellin' you

I'm not that bad  the fun we had

The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette  I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds  man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man  it might kill her  it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say

Platinum off a mixtape  sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies  roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it  they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck  making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe  make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city  I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch  had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day  tryna lose weight

Hotel bed springs  we'll wear it out

I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well  if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List  these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses  I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick  Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well  this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down

I come from murder one  brung late night melee
Say  say  say
We hung all summer  sprung mattress with bae bae
Say  say  say
Trippin' off Dyke  and my name strike with pay day
Say  say  say
Flippin' blue lightning  tightening  strapped with AK
Say  say  say
OG one  told me one  show me one  eight ways
How to segue
Pussy  power  profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate  with fame
Light limo tint with light women  dark women in it
Awe Kenny  good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star  boy
Astronomer  anonymous
I line 'em up  we grind 'em up  there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up  I tallied up all the parts  boy
Twenty legs  arms  head (Head)
Head  head  and more head (Head)
Oh God  bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life  high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga  why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock  I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land  I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything  I'm a hustler  came from

But I know what's mine when I see it

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen  now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention  now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken  I was broken  I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want  girl  we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table  we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas  they got choices

Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant

Sky's getting cold  we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets

Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight

Fast life gripping

Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop

So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping

Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving

Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Man  if pole dancing's an art  you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail  got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go  walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you  be you
Yeah girl  just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown  it been going down  it ain't new
That's that north north  that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good  don't stress though
First night fuck  never really planned it
Take a deep breath  no one need to panic
Lips so French  ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention  I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place  shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah"

Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science

I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc  that’s a mentor
Had some bad business  nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones  dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show  give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO  XO  XO
Mix it up  pour it up  take it down slow
This is my sound  nigga  fuck your sound
Did it from the ground  ask around  bitch
When I touch down  I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man  I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back  kid back  kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts  I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO  shout out to the boy who
Broke bread on tour  man  it’s all over now
Shout my nigga Stixx  doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing  city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny  can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained  I make all of them swallow

Exactly who I need to be

Left here is the mold of a man
That you guided  that you guided
A part of me  is you  and we will live on

I won't let this carry on

Then i will create my own

You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um  which part?"

And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep  I would have slept by now

Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes  do you picture me?
When you fantasize  am I your fantasy?
Now you know

A little change in the household name but ain't too much changed

Now if you like the tone
And how the harmony's done
And the sucka MC's die before they've begun
Well I'd like to know if
You've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from country sides to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these MC's even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills
That's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the 100 watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenant of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat
Recline and take a seat

The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats pull out your cuts

Freak the future far from here and now
With style  release increase the peace  uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one  teach one  reach one  young gun
On one  listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul  we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Super syllable  major to the minimal
Every individual  bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen  jaw-jappin'  fast rappin'

Yo  I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'alls
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men pretend to put somethin' in bitches

Don't stop Hobbes  I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith  I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus  serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brains's software glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battered and slain
I get rude and go  to your show and use your own
Fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro  mean like Joe Greene when I blow steam
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
They show laughter when I flow faster  your ho have to
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settle we left in the rubble to crush metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire  make you first to bit  try me
Like Osama  or Dahmer  I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby  walk hard  the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin'  still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it  who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb  what type of shit was you on?
'Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)

All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any  bring it  I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh  your majesty  word flash photography
Third class economy  blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy  blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed  my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed 'cause I'm true to the rhyme

Ain't heard the worst of me  until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

Put a 20 on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick 'cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong  but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong  and just like ping-pong
Back and forth  I spit Molotovs  it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
One consider it pride  it's J5
When another deadly medley  camera  action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti

The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with  and then slip

As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction  seduction  attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
Would love to cross the line
But that’s why we built these walls

We been friends for a long time  a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine  but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine  think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine  but respect a thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea  but get brought back
To reality  and could you really live with that?
Decision  based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

An ongoing kinship  we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man  please understand  my rhyme is your repent

I'm not an expert on how relationships should work
But  (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo  it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you  all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune  you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl  you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo  whatchu doin after this?)
Infactuation was authentic  but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe  I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter  then tear it up
Or do a song  just to say what's up
I want just a touch

We been friends for a long time  a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine  but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine  think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine  but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time  a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine  but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine  think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine  but respect a thin line

I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else  don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the roo-ooo-ooom

This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion

Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross  ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with  but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship  respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm tryin to salvage a friendship

While you cramming to understand these contraband lyrics
My fam submits to pray  5 times a day
Climbing into your mind with live rhyme display
J5 finds a way to remain supreme
Coming verbally Hardison as if my name was Kadeem

Ayo my team Dreamworks without Spielberg or spill words
Communicate from the Earth throughout the universe
I transmit  transcipts  transcontinental lyrics
Deeply rooted in your spirit
Up  I love the power of words  nouns and verbs
The pen and the sword  linguistic Art of War
No folklore or myths in my penmanship
The path of Scholar Warriors is what I present  uh
Verbally decapitating those against a
Jihad fi sabilillah  my words make sense
She gots to get up on your vocab  you gots to have vocab
Letters makes words  and sentences makes paragraphs

Yo  I make the pen capsize  the verbal with the planted eyes
Planning knives ever pair that I utilize
Spit juice  crack blood from your tooth
Inflict truths  speak Allah's 99 attributes

You baby MC's drink Pedialyte
While underground doesn't like you  the media might
But we the defeat will change that
As we bridge gaps in this lyrical grudge match  brothers we slug back

Yeah  we bless tracks with the help of a raw rap
Inprinted like poor tracks all over your brain rack
My mental maneuver will clear and steer right through ya
We Grand like Puba  understand that we move ya

Ayo  my rhythm reveal rollercoaster real deal
Revolutionize with active build
I plant my dreams in the field and wait to harvest my skills
For the starving MC  hungry trying to get a meal

Ayo my quality control  captivates your party patrol
Your mind  body  and soul
For whom the bell tolls  let the rhythm explode
Big  bad  and bold b-boys of old
We're going to take a trip back in time
Are you ready to get into your time machine
Ok  fasten you sealt belts

It's like front and center for those who don't get it
We hit it and stay committed  the skies is the limit
Rock on and twist it  hop it  don't stop it
Drop it like it's heavy when the DJ knock it

Tight swifts  so vivid  my folks is close knitted
With every note we're gon' get close to your spirit
If not post and pivot some folks just don't get it
We got a gross fetish for beats and dope lyrics

For real  watch my community as we stomp through your city
Destroying every and any club or academy
Rap style too plenty  baby  rain  snow or sunny
The game is nose runny  my team is your money

Yes  Lord  it's hard to not give us applause
Accolades and awards  they even out the odds
A little fire the bars  a flame you can't dodge
We kill 'em and play hard with with 'em 16 bars


We like to mash off  bogart  kill it when the track's hard
Yes  y'all  fresh  y'all  flyest shit you ever saw
A to the K  I to the L rock well
Hit the block  tip topping every jail cell

Push the panic button cause we like a planet comin'
Vicious avalanche or something plus I ain’t retracting nothing
Enough said  we roll with rough dreads
You old and busted  my crew we hustling

Yeah  we grandslam when we can’t stand fishes
One hell of a band and my plans ambitious
We allergic to lies and to ham sandwiches
We stay flexible for if the grand plan switching

So if by chance you catch a glimpse
Of the West co-representative  5 star commemorative
Rap far from primitive  inventive
Just hear it and remember it’s us  J5


Yo  we came to push up on ya
Southern California  top notch performer
With the corner of Roma
Run up on ya  yeah  tell it to a friend
We suck it up and blow it out in the wind

And we come from the beginner  never been a pretender
Seven letters and put ‘em together  kill the competitor
Better than most  we servin’ devils for dinner
Tryna get to one of the seven levels agenda  for real

We set trends and never follow behind
My crew be swallowing rhymes while you following dimes
We take it to the limit  no gimmicks or false images
Style is all scrimmage  that’s why I’m all linen

We certified to vibe and cutting off the air supply
We kick  spit  stab and kill every vocab
The minute we go back   the old school rhythm we shown that

I'm heated with y'all  the defeated will fall
Incomplete and unsolved when the word freedom's involved

Got rid of slavery but still kept the penitentiary
And now freedom got a shotgun and shells with your name
Release the hot ones and let freedom reign

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out  we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now  make it right now

We live and we learn  we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust  I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling  so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out  we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now  make it right now

These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though they names changed
And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train
In the end  makin it rights the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out  we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now  make it right now

Now if you know what I know you need to work it out
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
You havin problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible but God is most merciful
Many works  Many men converse
With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out

With the constant complaint  we other gonna make it fly
Or we ain't  I already know what some of ya think
Ima talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryna pull a brother  im not
Lookin for nobody to judge  you said you ain't I never said you was
Im just tryna get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing do the right thing
Made for your life game  plus my man might sing

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out  we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now  make it right now
A don't stop stop your dreamin

Ya see I'm coming with the healing plan
Leaving my enemies spinning like a ceiling fan
Now while the rest assume

In a session I take it back like a dressing room

Turn a wrench and you're convinced

Grab the mic so you don't react
The double X Polo shirt with the hat to match
In fact  we verbally vibrate your track

Then crush your confidence like plastic condiments
Build you up to break you down like forgotten monuments
The question is this: will they return with the hot shit?
Or keep it on the low flow

Yo  and for you confused bastards  Tuna the blues master
Quick to grib the mic  crews fast and soundclashing
Critical mass  pinnacle blast have been deflected
Hypodermic vocals I flash get you infected

I don't sip on brew  so this Bud's for you
Speak when spoken to whenever you come through
My vibes fill you  Internal your Revenue
You rhyme prostitute for little or no loot

Cause a lotta these kids think that commercial
Is rocking fly suits and jewelry
But we can rock shows with no rehearsal
With the Rebels of Rhythm and Unity

Yeah  cause I'm nice  smooth  hard as a bone
Since I pick up the microphone I'm hotter than brimstone
The razor sharp crossbow accurate
We drop the multiverbal milligram suppliment

Plus in bed  theological word advance
Been Too Legit To Quit before the Hammer pants
The parent to the pen converts words to song
Stay blacker than the New York Harlem Renaissance

No comp  we paint a darker picture  in your sector
Perfect verbal architecture  sparking lectures
Lyrics infectious  fuck your Lexus
If you ain't giving God your praise then it's useless
When MC's try to make hits and them shits flop
Running races like they was Penelope Pitstop
Develop these hits rock bottom  the disk jock got 'em
Souped up  but his rhyme is beating his loops up

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Dah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah

I can see clearly now  top of the pile with my style
Check the profile  it shifts like sundials
Crisp like young smiles  we rip and run wild
Intent to rock crowds  some bite like rottwilds

Your game is disconnected  misdirected
Disrespected  when we come in  expect some next shit
The J-U-R-A  classical forte
Get low down & dirty like the eel moray

My heart pump the rhythm of the militant street life
Soldier of composure up under the street light
The coat style  prototype  professional
Media light shine bright  now kill all the
Bullshit  cheap talk and lip service
Jealousy and envy and undertone curses in your verses
Serve the purpose of a nigga living nervous
Unsure and uncertain but about to short circuit

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah
Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah

Ayo my gift of gab should be sold in bags
Boost up the price tag  make a wack rapper mad
Rely on my right side  securing our tape tight
Tasty tangibles to your mandible and clavicle

Yo  easily 2na be  cleverly swelling my treasury
Vocal pedigree for you critics who try to measure me
But easily I'm about to run you down my resume
Had a bundle of struggle from birth to my present day

Yo  your love don't compute  perhaps you need a boost
A magical flute  some nose candy to toot
Before you get loose  express and tear the roof
You claim you got the juice  but you lame and out the loop

So I associated myself with fossilized figures
Crack the summer sizzler  hit the real live niggas
My influence is gunshots and trauma units
Street trends  with material word friends

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah

You invite many fools when you ligt chemicals
Night of the living ooze  your ego makes many bruise

You need to watch what you choose  what you give is what you get
Some are lacking intellect in their quest for a check
Is it love or respect  does the subject get you vexed?
Only 4 bars to wreck  the situation is complex

Yo  you in constant pursuit to be the last in the house

Complainin’  me and my clan are unscathin’
From the soul comes something amazing

If you only knew  the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew  we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to

How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain’t payin my bills
Or feeding my kids  judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you’re a star
Why you frontin’ (you ain’t nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing
If your people still wanting

And you got money ain’t givin’ them nothing

Flossin and frontin

Your game of charades
The way you behave
The image you save
Your brother thats one big parade
I’m sick of your ways
I’m sitting here spitting the phrase
The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with the gays

If you only knew  the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew  we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to

Cast the first stone
Blast the verse
No matter the class

Kickin' it for you hipocritic berzerk ohms
I'm hopin' at worst
Hopin' the words that touch home
And clutch domes
Ya' think
Electrical sockets and wet feet
How you infinitely get sleep
The minute we get deep
Ladies and 'gents peep
One hundred percent heat
Up undersea mistreats
Now I'll leave you mince meat
Yes I'm from UNITY
My last name sits in the middle of opportunity (Huh)
With two-laid plans and new-made fans
My crew raid lands and punch like the Kool-Aid Man

We are some designated  poetical brothers with mics
For whoever had skills to possess the gift
Combinated with the flavor and it go like this...Tuna Fish!

I'm amphibious  citizen with the lesson plan
Cashier at the J5 concession stand (Akil!)

The militant steel with the peripheral
Telegraphic skill build up force field (Mark 7even!)

Fundamentalist bringing my verbal gift
My style is packed Quik like cocoa in Swiss Miss (Zaakir!)

For the way my pen sticks to rhymes
Cause a million party people  it's about that time

And together  we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one

I be the spark from the cannon  blaze the outstanding
Tug of war  with the poor  rich  and scandalous
Roadrunning bandit  race against advancement
Style winds cause storms when I perform

I'm a Parker John robot and stomp your whole spot
And beat you whole crew to a bunch of know-nots
Dissect you from the inner then declare myself the winner
Once the style clears  you'll be grilled like dinner

I'm 2na the Black  your contractor
Attacking your backdoor  you're trapped in my trash compactor
Move back  bore  swingings before the trap door
It's causin the capture of brothers who rap more

Yeah  check the shelling  rock niggas redder than watermelon
The grief-stricken  rotated 20/20 vision
Rap felon  hottest rebel with bad spelling
I pitch shift with unprecedented sharpness

Distributor  local street corner contributor
Word inhibitor  scientific impositioner
Rhythm Commission DJs for real
""He drives the crossfader like a cutmobile""
We perpetrate the fake  the fraud  the phony
Jurassic Masters of the Ceremony
You came and saw them right before your eyes
In fact the old school flavor has survived  like this...

Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
So whoever bought the tape bring your butt right back
Cause you never in your life heard a cut like that

Hey  we flip fast phonographs 45 records smash
Hot weather forecast  ain't nothing they never had

Make a move  never lose  competition quick to choose
New styles  hot rhymes  guarenteed to blow your mind
(Who is he?) The subtle ?? fanatic for unity
Demonstratin the ghetto diplomatic immunity

Well I'm the style stimulist  sound photosynthesis
Super with the sentences in the Latin centuries

And together  we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one

Now what do you like the most about this
Conflict  consequence  constant evidence
A classic content communicated conference
Whether 5 or 6 whether a number misprint
Or if it seems that you heard it before
If you thought that you would never hear it no more
You should never doubt when we runnin word o' mouth
Be concerned about your health (let's go!)

Now you know us but it's not the Cold Crush
Four MC's so we ain't the Furious
Not the Force MC's or the 3 from Treacherous
It's a blast from the past from the moment we bust
From whatever we touch  we hold platinum plus
But if our shit go rust  still In God We Trust
Cause it's the second coming
Display a rhyme so stunning
We keep it runnin  and give a shoutout to London
And keep it all  and still perform till the early morn'
Sunset til dawn

Why you actin plastic
Treatin all ya fans like fanatics
We be the upper pair comin' air-tight like Tupperware
Fuck a fear  press ya luck and beware the brigadier
Yea  DJ's be spinnin the records that make up the music
So people can focus whenever the mic has been passed to me
The more drums we have in our kit  the more jobs we can handle
We gonna take a break here..
Lets go. wait wait yaself

And you can tell when in the crew I do my duty-o

So sup grab the mic and pull the magic out ya mouth
We be the rhythm kings  plus rhyme channelings
 Go ahead
Snare(repeated 21 times)
Light emcee can't match this phatness so we practice
Burnin through walls of wackness
Yo  2 emcees add a little more spice
So we concentrate on mic's to keep them packed parties tight
*THREE* emcees underground and worldwide
Surgeon general notify that the 5 is certified
*FOUR* emcees at your door once more
When it rains it pours from the heavens to the Earth floor
*FIVE* Elements  vocal instruments super extra strength hip-hop activist
*FIVE* For your mind no time and intertwine
Roll with the rhymes sunset to sunrise

I was sittin at the television feelin' disturbed
Hey yo  I just got the word  off Tigram and 83rd
Some cat that got clapped  (gangster rapper?)
Perhaps  But I was lookin at the face of one particular cat
Now I done seen him before  (Can you remember where at?)
Well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat
Or at a party and shit  ?or drive through of a quickie split?
But the fellas her ran wit  they no longer ex-- (yo  dude peep this)

Yo I know dude  I been knowin him all my life
Ever since I was young I used to see him shootin' dice
On occasion I would see him once or twice
With all types  many different walks of life
He tried to keep in touch  but I knew what was up
Every time he came around and showed his face I ducked
In the mid-eighties  the nigga went crazy
He had alot of ladies selling they babies  the nigga was shady
But he had alot of friends that he would visit on the weekends
Thrill seekin  influenced by his teachings
My daddy knew him  yo  he met him at a hotel
My homeboy Johnny  kicked it with him in a jail cell
Alot of people met him with a female
Doing real well  connected with the drug sales
The rich and the poor  for better or worse
The last and the first  walked the earth  but can't avoid his turf
And it hurts my brain  he's drivin me insane
It's a shame I can't remember his name
I think 2na know dude  Soup  I ain't tryin ta be dude
But my wife just cooked  im bout to grab up some food

Aiight peace  2na said he probably runnin the streets
I'm about to give these young brothas a beep

You seen him?

Yeah we met that brother out in Pasadena
Remember  7even?

On Marengo

No my mistake  we were right between fair oaks and lake
Tryin to take us a lunch break

And cop us a sess sack!

But had to drive right past the place where they rest at

We drove in a hatchback

Corolla  these cats pack pistolas  the cadillac they drove
(7even)
It was brown and black

Patrollin the hood  lookin for trouble
Saw us purchasin trees
Lurkin with speed  pulled the strap  and was hurtin to squeeze

You ?jerk? and you bleed

Threw it in reverse and we fleed

Or should we say fled?

They wanted to make us more than play dead  flashin his heat

NO!

The Game
Playing to survive
Aiming to win anyway they can

Pass the ball  final casting call
First of all  verbal basketball
Off the glass  smash your jaw
Too fast for y'all
You might take a nasty fall
Trying to stick with the prehistoric passenger
(Foul Ball)
All breath  no physical contact
Bounce back  demonstrate invincible bomb raps
Not no hustler no player or speakin no crime crap
I'm vocally trying to score before my time lapse
Uh! Full court press  hands in your chest
Runnin' cause I'm a rebel with the ghetto
No fouls just checks  make a brother sweat
Word for y'all to earn my reject
Get it out of here  attack from the rear
Ya'll niggas ain't nothin but some bitch ass queers
I'll be in your ear  increase the fear
Rippin with the shears as the crowd just cheers
Bring on the opposition
Cause my position is to shut you down
As the basketball pounds on the concrete floor
Envisioning moves to freak brothers every which way
Dominating like Doc J
Pass me the rock  I know just what to do with it
It's real vivid  I pivot  through the lane
Three hundred and sixty behind my back
I take your monkey ass to the rack like Jerry Stack
I'm saw by most recruiters and heavily recommended
Stickin your best shooters they lower verbal percentage
It's takin its toll  24-second clock control
Stoppin this obstacle  impossible
I was the number one ???? project in the city
Prospect  now thats something that you can believe
So be it  whether pro or collegiate  the hit but don't miss
Prime time the offense  switch
Y'all can't ball  Y'all can't ball
Yo ref  where's the tech? Man  make the call
The game is gettin tight verbal victories in sight
What counts is what you write not concerned about the hype
My rhymes go baseline so why you tryin to take mine?
Last man tried just died inside the paint line
I bank rhymes  got a call so I flex
I'm on the foul line with a few verses left
When my flow hits the net  the next brother flex
I put my foot in the pavement
With the brothers I'm raised with
Play with and break dance back in the days with
And still in the game with 12 points  4 assists
Get up in the game  in your face like swish
Crash the boards with metaphors
In the air like a concord
Aiyyo what you out for?
Yo I'm out for the whole score
22 flat seconds for me to win
I can't win for losin with this cheatin ass ref

My squad's supreme
So I don't need Clyde or the dream
Next time you play the game boy pick a better team
Your choice is short when you on a concrete court
But my mental cohorts is bout to change the whole sport
Give me the pill boy  crossover with the skills
Wrap around pass  fly right past your grill
Take off from half court  in some J5 shorts
The rap band with the man when my words play sports
Comin' through your lane  with pure skills so stand clear
Vocal charge is a mirage  I still stand here
Damn near  make your shit look soft like Pam Grier
Fans cheer for the paragraph Bill Lambier
Show me the rock  so I can show these fool what I got
(He's heating up) Fuck that  I'm flaming hot
Verbally take you to the blacktop  and wreck shop
Turn my game up a notch  pass me the rock
1 on 1  3 on 3  5 on 5  horse  21
It really don't matter cause son you'll still get done
Yo you should know better than try to barter with this globetrotter
Militious  vicious dunks  I'm Vince Carter
And it's the high draft pick  flashin it
Still can penetrate and slightly overweight
But whatever it takes my shot can elevate
No pain  no gain for the brothers with no game"

Addicts wean from it
Where dreams and green run it

Supreme livin'  seein' more demons than Gene Simmons
And mean fibbin' actors be adlibbin'
Fakin' the funk and some of us naturally had rhythm
Some of us act like they had women
Gats in the abdomen back when the fact is them cats
They didn't have nuttin

The purest diction
Insures their jurisdiction
I'm kicking it up a level trying to stay in the red
Some stay in the bed  zombie
Like the Day of the Dead
With decay in the head
Playin' instead of stayin' ahead

They run down when they touch ground
They climb up the structures unsound

While some of these politicians secretly suppress facts

My wrongs I right

Get the power to fight

And some of us find fault in the sin and not the sinner

Push pressure on my peers
That's why most of these brothers have short term careers
You appear to be what's happenin'
For a year you crackin'
One hitter quitter now you missin' in action
With no satisfaction from the streets
I only hear foolishness when you speak
I repeat  my predecessor's endeavor with pleasure
Lock and load  explode and come better
Hopin that generation X
Be more wicked with the flex
And not so quick to cash a check
And disrespect  talkin' guns and sex
Chasin' death  but end up gettin' layed to rest
At your request
You're at the end of your line
Out of your mind
Idle women  weed and wine
And shells for your nine
The blind lead the blind
Time after time
When you rhyme for the shine
Chorus (2X)

Yo  I'm tellin' you to REBEL
But dude  if you stale
The 2na can tell
Either you're comin' to the party or you truant as hell
Politicians ain't got no problem puttin' you in the cell
It's like we rolled up a snowball and threw it in hell
See some of us are looted with mail and suited to swell
But still blind like you're fluent in Braille

Yo  I never can tell uh  why some make it or fail
Speak it and spell overcome and still prevail

We ripple the water frequently
Blink if we show delinquency  please
Human frequencies
Have been diseased  A breeze ain't what I'm feelin'
Healin' is essential
Mental aggrivation shows you what we've been through

Yo  sign of the times influence the way I rhyme  man
Pick up a nine and put down your picket sign  man
Your life is worth way more than just some diamonds
Without bling I still gleam
Glisten and shine  man

Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you  all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm  too young  too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride  my ego  my needs  and my selfish ways
Caused a good  strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never  never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh ooh

And held your hand

Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh  I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

Do all the things I should have done

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere  there's melody and harmony
For you and me  tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name

Everybody says  ""Say something""
Then  ""Say something  say something""
Then  ""Say something  say something""
Then  ""Say something""
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it

There'll never be

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl  I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn  to cry
So cry me a river

Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

20 000 leagues away  catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light  thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace  I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here  fade out and disappear

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed

I'm tryna ease your mind  word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

Okay fine  I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there  or it's mine

Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault

Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like

No  I'm not  that  I'm not

Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances  yeah  I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage  which I also call home  when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello  it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave  I just wanna say  ""Hi  Dad""

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less  and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution  a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution  'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy  they know that I'm not
But at best  you can see I'm not sad

I fucked up  I know that  but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it  the darkness  the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change  but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking  you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark  I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance

When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session  I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem  it was never much
Just a trick  to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh  how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man  he was a thug
His name was Lee  he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock  yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last  on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless  I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by

She keeps on pa--

When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart  got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad  and I could be her nigga
But  all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated  highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated  I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping  I'll try to stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken  chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star  thinking I was like a fan
Damn  she looked good  downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot  a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn  and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless  I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless  I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

Now there she goes again  the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait  no  I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her  secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her  and it went
My dear  my dear  my dear  you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt  I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely  the one who loves you dearly  PS Love Me Tender
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender  damn

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up  fool?! Nigga  what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering  ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?
I tried to talk and tell them  chill  I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work  I wasn't scared  just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip  yes  ya get blown

There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please  they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school  I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it  I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words  just debris

And now that I'm older  stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders  but I told y'all

Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be (that I'm a celebrity
Who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me
Cause when you in my position  it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'

I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle of O.E

Hung out to dry

And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies

You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands

Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls  and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts

With twenty-two burritos  but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (what?) ya mama smokes crack (what?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Ya mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles  but no  she's not cute
She's not pretty  oh what a pity  got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-aid  just for the kiddies

I said excuse me lady  but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
Cause you was beatboxin for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue

Awwwwwwww  ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat; I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
Cause that would blow me round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Oh  how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods  woody woodpecker would if he could
But I didn't want to pass it up
To the next man had my walkman bumpin' on
The fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller driller tiller out with the miller brew
Filler up  took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweettalker so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone  slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin ""ooh"" and I'm busted for real

Oh shit  oh shit  oh shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me grease
Cuz I slips and I slides when I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom sittin in a tree
K-i-s-s (i-n-g)
Yo  first comes the tongue
And then come the she my homey's m-o-m what (m-i-e)
Yo  and to think from day one in my eyes I show fear cuz
I stepped into his house his  Mom's grinnin ear to ear
Gigglin and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin me up for the kill
Oh what the hell is what I said to myself so that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple  said  ""Suck it if you like but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam par dick ma wah
I took this old bitch in a doggie style
Greg walked in the room that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was  ""Oh shit!""

Oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh

One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude  she was dope  man  real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey a beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach  deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin on my booty
Suck suck suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (why?)
Cuz everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like ""Quit  B""
Bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden as if someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me  oh please god no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me  yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go: shit!
Oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh

We was like that you know
Yeah  and I bet you got laid back
Yeah  I'mma uh  I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man  don't sweat it  yo  we gonna catch some stuff  dude
Oh no  I'm kinda tired
Nah  we got a basket  we're gonna fill this basket before we go  yo
Aight  bro
'Cause the otha fish is better...

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome  my head  my skull  my cranium
My eyes have had enough  it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time  we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove  I didn't bust no  uh  hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know  we got together  word  I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella  now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp  pimp  and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's other fish in the sea  that is  in the sea

In the sea

You know there's other fish  in the sea  that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

I reminisce  try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends  though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am  still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind  sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den  B
Macho  but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented  but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich  and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal  dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up your eyes  babe  my mate  I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb  as you swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea that is

In the sea
You know there's other fish  in the sea  that is

Now  if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya  but I didn't even know ya
Bro  you're stupid  'cause ya thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips  or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip  Elizabeth  this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull  but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy  they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby  I'm pushing up the daisies  but
Hey diddle diddle  I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar  miss
No  I won't diss  I'm just like off to other fish in the sea

In the sea  baby

You can't leave love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse  another loves for hire

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
(x2)

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp  feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes  sweatshirt  jeans  and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say  ""How ya doing?"" She say  ""I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing  fibbin  and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed  bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said  ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down.""
I know my homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when—


Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real  working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said  if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that  right now  right now  right now  baby
Right now  right now  right now  baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
And she said
You know that she said
And she said

That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete 'cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by  let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sens
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line


I got a big ol' blunt  I'm lampin' on my front porch
About to put a torch to it  then Coco said don't do it
Please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son
She sent him inside the house meanwhile my Sheri steadily rolled one
After the other  then another  'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
So we rolling the indo as if the kid didn't know
He's lookin' through the window  yo why we tryin' to hide it?
To make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
About the bud!? Now I have to play the part of the adviser
Because the bud is just the tasty tantalizer
The bud not the beer 'cause the bud makes me wiser
(Figaro) So I said come're little man
And with his little hand  he grabbed the pipe
A lesson in buddah blessin'  not too young  just right
So he started blazin'  it was amazin'
My lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
But who am I to deny the kid a try
At nature's little way of sayin' hi?
So pack


Twisting turning burning
Rings of fire when I come into ya layer
Say ya pay yer fare for the fee
I see
The pipe  the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it  I really want to smoke it
I choke it

Never been a bitch so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie
And for creeps that's asleep you better ring the alarm clock

Originate trends  my rhymes they get paid
So I'm making ends and beginnings  see  I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC 'cause I flips when I sways it
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era

I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth  clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'mma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before  and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty  my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me  locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mike with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next  well you're just too dense

On the downlow

On the downlow

He's chasin' me  scrapin' my knee on the cement is what I did
What dug  look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night -stalker slug  but know  this nigga had to go
Peep this  I was asleep  he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I've got my nine I said  with my millimeter go bang
I got him  he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang  yep I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But um anyway I'm just protectin' my shit
Cause if it wasn't me he's killin' then my moms mighta got it
It's on the downlow
Don't tell nobody I killed him all right?

The homeys kick the fact cause its wack to let you fall

And you're fucked  crazy fucked  like the slut Heather Hunter

Yo man they tryin' to run a power move on us man
Yo man
You got to tell the suckers what's up boy
Yeah ha-ha

I got a letter from the DMV
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended
For a minute then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock
On the dot
So I think I'd better
Scoot off to school
Cause in class there's a test
I gotta dress fast
Grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn
As hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride
Pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse
Into first
And disperse and
From that very moment on my day got worse

As I was standing in the street
I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way
I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room
It took a minute  boom
Hopped into the car
We drove away in a zoom
I assume doom
As we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble
About my life (is that's a) shambles
Should of took the bus
A bus without the silence or some old Nikes
I wish we had good bikes
We need to exercise
Maybe we could take a hike
An' you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk I would not have to say please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Away
To our destination
No license no insurance
Not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray
But it's really blue
Who would
Think we're up to good
Four black niggas ridin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses
Makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly
Playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while
We see girls jog
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights (ooh)
(yo baby what's up  pull over)
(you live with your homeboys? Yeah I live with my
Homeboys  that's where you're takin' me to your house
Where your homeboys are? I mean but they're not
Home  you ain't got your own crib? naw I ain't got)
(5-0 man  5-0)

Lights  action
Without the camera
Si-reens and high beams
Two to a tee
The blue coat billy goats are crowding up my rear view
Hot on the tail of an innocent being
My heartbeat is racin' at a pace so fast
I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass
My tail  can't go to jail cause it's wack
What would happen to my girl and my record contract
Yo fellas (what)
Take off the baseball caps
Word up I heard that the nerves get tapped
And throw on the glasses and give up the (tees)

Baby tell me why it's gotta be like that
(x4)

I wasn't sleepin I was creepin’  slidin'  hidin'
I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
Mentally sinkin’  presently brinkin’
Two decades and a half makin’ a path for mine to follow
The world is hollow  yet it's full of crap prepare to gamble
I give you a handful of chips and tips
For what's to come  I cried a ton of tears
Drunk a ton of beers  that's fun at first
But learned to persevere throughout the years
Kept my ears open  eyes scoping mouth locked
Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
Nobody may be there with the limb to lend
This is the end  still I can't explain the fact
Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?


Know what  I said it
Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
That they need to be beheaded
Why? I'm readily  steadily stimulating and mutilating
All sloppily copied imitations  cause they irritatin'
So I'm intimitading them over the snare
With simply a stare
Bringin them turbulent terror
And they know this ‘cause they can feel it
He knew that it was mine still the sucker tried to steal it
So I had to reveal it  through provin’
That I am astonishing and fly
And by just blinking my eye
In a flash I flush out the face  layin' low-key
Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
Mister sometime-homey  why he act like that
I thought he had my back
I thought he had our backs
But it was him who I should've never trusted
And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
Or mouth busted for acting all dusted  but bust this
Now when I'm out I seek and thought out the whole scene
For all sinister types  sneaks that scheme
They come into my face  I send them tightmen home
When they be suffering from the double-agent syndrome
Why it gotta be like that?


Sometimes this world means everything to me
The inside is lovely to these eyes I see
And sometimes in my mind all I wanna do is cry
Highly up-set but nothing drops from my eye
Those drain out my skin cause I'm pissed from within
I see a situation now and all I do is grin
People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling
Aging is your times cause life's unraveling
While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic
I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight
People need to know about this thing called life
Cause if you see the light then life's alright
So can you dig it?


I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission
Popped in my freestyle tapes  started reminiscing
About my little homie  who was raised in Wyoming  wanted to be famous
So he came to Californey on the microphony
He was super bad and what not
But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot
He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
That he modificated  rearranged his behavior
He hooked up quick with the influential slang
Gangsta-stroll  cornrolls; the whole shabbang
Braggin' and boastin  boastin' and braggin
How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin'
Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon
Hopin' they'd hit him in the head  but he steady saggin'
Like he a hog
Creepin' through the smog
Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
Like most who come to this West Coast society
Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
So what a relic way to end this
Got rolled up when he was strolling
On a Sunday at the Venice
Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson
The hard way I'm guessin' yessin'
Deedy as I hit the Beady and make a right on Weston
Pops in my head the proverbial question"

Ain't got ten dollars for a drink at the bar

Sniff sniff  yo  what does the ip smell?
A brother like Suave with a pocket that swell
Action was thrown  the ip was blown
Next thing you know  I had her at my home!
All alone  object to get paid
Only thing that happened was a ass got laid!
Now no ends and her ass was sprung
Used a little tongue  but believe I'm well hung

I said ""for sure"" cuz what God gave us  girl  I'm grateful
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight
Waitin for a nigga so now I figure
""Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today""
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say...
Now I get back the very next week only to learn
The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every
Night gettin blunted
And zooted with a clique of well known
Reputed groupie hoes from all the hip hop shows
Backstage with her little backpack tryin to get chose
By anotha nigga with talent wealth and fame
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame
For turning her out into a hip hop freak
Now I seek counseling
From a therapist twice a week

So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the
Freak
Instantly she made another selection
Because he was in the lime plus had
The money connection ""correction""
""way more paid"" is why she laid and played
A charade in the game of deception
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress
Of the mattress cuz she's a wanna be mack-tress
Well built-but equipped with the tackiest of tactics
And I hate it why this is dedicated to all of them
Type of women who still be swimming Lost and confused
In the lake of illusion with no values is why they're
Constantly losin'"

So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart  they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear  tongue and butts
Yeah  they're trying to fuck us up
But  shit  you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb
Chorus: repeat 4X
Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own

Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own
Chorus: repeat 4X

I was po'  black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out  wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate  couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school  why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift  got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it  1-2  we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil"

This one here goes out to my man Pooky (?)
This one goes out to the (?)
And all those who passed away (?)
And we go round and round
Life is just a moment in time (x4)

I recall being three when Sunny passed away
One of the greatest in my eyes till this very day
Too young to understand but understood the ways of good and evil
Life and death was in the breath of times fate
And God only knows what kept Peggy straight
Cuz in the very next year my Aunt Dorothy was the late
More beautiful than the word it was like killing a mocking bird
She was so young like the new year was all you heard
Almost saw it so clear the good times that we had
When my Momma showed me pictures life wasn't so bad
I got baby sat By Pat when Bedie was a small guy
And in our cousins eyes we were both small fries
Jazzywazzys growing up to be a big girl now
Father figure understands a man might like her profile
I let sink in a while and told let 'em like ya style
Both you and Ebony I be damned if this short life
Ain't heavenly peace and harmony family season and it goes...
And we go round and round
Life is just a moment in time..."

You could've told me

And I thought that I knew you
Better than that  better than that
Better than that  better than that

So  So  So
From the beginning it was known
Had a brother here  but now he's gone (real gone)
He's not six deep  find him on 6th Street
His mind now mincemeat  sleeping on concrete
Can tell when she went to sleep  she's still weak
About a big bro  overdid it one day
Decide to hit her  no booz  no drugs  no playaz
No thugs  no luv no hugs
When she caught me  found the stash in the coffee?
Call me from the payphone speaking real softly
That I've broken the seal of trust
On her way to her momma's house
On the bus  it was old for us  don't make a fuss
She said  as the tears shed  explained that she felt
Misled  she couldn't take the pain if I was jailed
Or found dead ...or from one upside the head
I tried to convince her  only happens to a few
How could I question  after all she'd been through
She said she felt bad  but there was nothin I could do
I thought I knew  I thought I knew
 - 2X

Yeah  me & my man's go back way before the music
I'd never thought that he would lose it and do that
All year he used to be in my house  but now I can't wait to
Smack the taste out of his mouth
They say that money is the root of all evil  but not having money
Is the root of all evil  chilling  talking  walking with my people
Talking the walk about how shit goin' be  we gonna rock under
Any circumstances  when I'm on the microphone
You know we advancin'  with or without you  can't fuck with you
We try to forget you  cause we're trying to get richer"
