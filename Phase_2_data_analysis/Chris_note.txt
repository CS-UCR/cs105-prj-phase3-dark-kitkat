1. Correlation between 'Danceability', 'Energy', 'Loudness' and 'Valence'.
    - Maybe songs that are more danceable have less loudness or valence. Maybe songs with higher energy are not danceable. Something along these lines.
2. Is artist popularity linked with any other feature? Does something seem to have an effect on artist popularity?
    - Maybe the more danceable a song is, the more popular an artist is. Or the more words in the lyrics, the more popular. Etc.
3. Check correlation between duration of song and amount of words.
    - If the song is longer, maybe there are more words. Maybe not. 
4. Correlate duration of song to genres.
    - Some genres may have longer songs. (The genres column needs cleaning.)
5. Sentiment analysis against every other feature.
    - Once sentiment analysis is added to the main dataset, we can correlate more features to sentiment of lyrics.

These are just some ideas. I also want to see how you did the sentiment analysis, Dmitri. I don't know what numbers you put for the analysis in your notebook. Are those numbers positive, negative, neutral or compound?
I believe we can make each sentiment it's own column. So, positive, negative, neutral and compound can be separate columns.

Another note on something I noticed on one song. A song by Ariana Grande called breathin has all the strings reversed, for some reason. Maybe we can clean that data, as well.
