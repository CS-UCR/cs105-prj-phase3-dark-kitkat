    "plain": "\u201cYesterday\u201d is track 9 on Atmosphere\u2019s 2008 album, When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold.\n\nBack in 2014, I spoke with Slug about what this song means.\n\n\u201cSomehow, the whole song was about me trying to make to make amends with my father who passed away,\u201d Slug told me at the time. \u201cYet the premise was about when somebody dies, you feel like you see that familiarity of them and you feel like you recognize them in the faces of strangers. So it came from seeing people around my city saying, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s my dad.\u2019 But really the song itself was about trying to make amends to the dead. I should have done that when he was alive. And I think that\u2019s where, ultimately, no matter what you hear when you hear the song, it\u2019s really about you as a listener. That song is there for a listener to pick up things for them, like, \u2018I can totally relate because my mom passed away\u2019 or \u2018my brother\u2019 or \u2018my friend\u2019 or some shit like that. Or you could just take it as being a song about making amends.\u201d\n\nIn the song, which is open letter to his dad, Slug reminisces about their relationship while reflecting on regrets, love and everything in between. And if the last line doesn\u2019t give you the chills, you didn\u2019t listen to the song."

Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\n\nI'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled\nTook it all back if I could, I put that on my soul\nAnd I would make a top notch good listener\nIf you could block off a little time out to give it here\nSince we went our separate paths\nI've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past\nI can't front, I'm having a blast\nBut damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last\nSitting here wishing we could kick it\nGive me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms\nI didn't mean to be distant, make a visit\nI'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen\nBut who am I jokin' with?\nThere's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it\nIt doesn't matter, this is more than love\nAnd maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of\u2026\n\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\n\nAnd when you left, I didn't see it coming\nI guess I slept, it ain't like you was running\nYou crept out the front door slow\nAnd I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know\nAnd by the the time I looked up, it was booked up\nPut it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff\nA whole house full of dreams and steps\nI think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept\nYou disappeared, but the history is still here\nThat's why I try not to cry over spilt beer\nI can't even get mad that you're gone\nLeaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me\nI'm sorry, it's official\nI was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple\nChip on the shoulder, anger in my veins\nHad so much hatred now it brings me shame\nNever thought about the world without you\nAnd I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you\nI thought I saw you yesterday\nBut I know it wasn't you, \u2018cause you passed away, Dad\n\nLooked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?",

       "plain": "\u201cYesterday\u201d is track 9 on Atmosphere\u2019s 2008 album, When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold.\n\nBack in 2014, I spoke with Slug about what this song means.\n\n\u201cSomehow, the whole song was about me trying to make to make amends with my father who passed away,\u201d Slug told me at the time. \u201cYet the premise was about when somebody dies, you feel like you see that familiarity of them and you feel like you recognize them in the faces of strangers. So it came from seeing people around my city saying, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s my dad.\u2019 But really the song itself was about trying to make amends to the dead. I should have done that when he was alive. And I think that\u2019s where, ultimately, no matter what you hear when you hear the song, it\u2019s really about you as a listener. That song is there for a listener to pick up things for them, like, \u2018I can totally relate because my mom passed away\u2019 or \u2018my brother\u2019 or \u2018my friend\u2019 or some shit like that. Or you could just take it as being a song about making amends.\u201d\n\nIn the song, which is open letter to his dad, Slug reminisces about their relationship while reflecting on regrets, love and everything in between. And if the last line doesn\u2019t give you the chills, you didn\u2019t listen to the song."

He might come out.\"\n\"Left you standing in the rain all wet.\"\n\"Wait, I just wanna say...\"\n\"No, no, who are you waiting for?\"\n\"A guy I met at the show.\"\n\"Who, Slug? You're waiting for fucking Slug?\"\n\"No! I mean no, uhh, yeah.\"\n\"Oh no, you're... You're fucking kidding me.\"\n\"He's so hot.\"\n(unintelligable)\n\"Fucking Slug? Oh my God, he is so fucking ugly.\"\n\nI wear my scars like the rings on a pimp\nI live life like the captain of a sinking ship\nThe one thing that I can guarantee\nI'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me\nBeen paying dues for a decade plus\nBefore that I was just another face on the bus\nTappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio\nDreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies\nOh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large\nSome day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car\nGonna go far, with charisma and skill\nUntil they put my face on a million dollar bill\nAtmosphere, it's just a ten letter word\nDiscretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird\nAnd if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard\nI think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured\nCaught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix\nI'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek\nIt's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak\nYou fucking freak, now keep your days out my week\nThe world keeps a balance, through mathematics\nDefined by whatever you've added and subtracted\nI'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain\nEmbrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly\n\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\n\nOnce upon a time in Minneapolis, yo\nI damn near had to steal the show\nI stepped on the stage - \"Who is it?\"\nMy name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes\nAnd what's up with the way that everybody gathers around\nEach other, so they can steal each others' sound\nIf it's all about getting down, with the get down\nHow long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?\nAppears more clear in its simplest form\nNobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm\nAbandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest\nMeasurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship\nI welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name\nI held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game\nWhen the soldiers started runnin' short on rations\nI began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'\nMake it happen, and take this captain to the gallows\nI keep steering us into an area that's shallow\nTalking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry\nSaid, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury\nSo give me some light, a little love and some liquid\nI'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot\nAnd when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow\nI'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly\n\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\n\nWhy scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen\nLet life be a bowl of melted ice cream\nOr be the deer that's caught in my high beams\nI'm rolling with the brights on\nScared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with\nParanoid, walking around, careless\nNo wonder you're in love with your therapist\nGo to sleep my little time bomb\n\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly",

   "lyrics": "Ain't no way to explain or say\nHow painful the hangover was today\nIn front of the toilet, hands and knees\nTrying to breathe in between the dry heaves\nMy baby made me some coffee\nAfraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me\nCouple of advil, relax and chill\nAt a standstill with how bad I feel\nI think I need to smell fresh air\nSo I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs\nThe sunlight hit me dead in the eye\nLike it's mad that I gave half the day to last night\nMy bad sight made me trip on my ass, right into that patch of grass like that's life\nAll of a sudden, I realize something\nThe weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin\nStood up and took a look and a breath\nAnd there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed\nNever really seen exercise as friendly\nBut I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed\nThe brakes are broken, it's alright\nThe tires got air and the chain seems tight\nHopped on and felt the summertime\nIt reminds me of one of them Musab lines like\n\nSunshine, sunshine, it's fine\nI feel it in my skin, warming up my mind\nSometimes you gotta give in to win\nI love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine\nSunshine, sunshine, it's fine\nI feel it in my skin, warming up my mind\nSometimes you gotta give in to win\nI love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine\nSunshine, sunshine, it's fine\nI feel it in my skin, warming up my mind\nSometimes you gotta give in to win\nI love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine\nSunshine, sunshine, it's fine\nI feel it in my skin, warming up my mind\nSometimes you gotta give in to win\nI love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine\n\nIf I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar\nBust it out whenever someone's actin hard\nSettle down, barbeque in the backyard\nThe kids get treats and old folks get classic cars\nEvery day that gets to pass is a success\nAnd every woman looks better in a sun dress\nThe sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice\nShow improve their moves and let loose\nI hear voices, I see smiles to match em\nGood times and you can feel it in the fashion\nEven though the heat cooks up the action\nThe streets still got butterflies\nEnough kids to catch 'em\nRidin my bike around these lakes man\nFeelin like I finally figured out my escape plan\nTake it all and the day started off all wrong\nSomehow now that hangover is all gone\nAin't nothing like the sound of the leaves\nWhen the breeze penetrates these southside trees\nLeanin' up against one, watchin the vibe\nForgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive\nIt's so simple, I had to keep the song simple\nWhen I get home I'm gonna open all the windows\nFeelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign\nA car pulled up, bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime\nSummer summers fine\nFeel it in my skin, warming up my mind\nSometimes you gotta give in to win\nI love the days when it shines, woah let it shine\nWoah let it shine\nWoah let it shine\nWoah let it shine\nWoah let it",

   "lyrics": "They love the taste of blood\nNow I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it\nMaybe they're as evil as they seem\nOr maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic\nAtmosphere finally made a good record\nYeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing\nThe last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this\nWas the last time we played a show in Cincy\n\"Get real\", they tell me\nIf only they knew how real this life really gets\nThey would stop acting like a silly bitch\nThey would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it\n\nDoesn't take much and that's messed up\nBecause these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us\nWhile everyone was trying to out-do the last man\nI was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man\nHello ma'am, would you be interested\nIn some sexual positions and emotional investments\nSee, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational\nWhen I be asking, \"Yo where did all the passion go?\"\nEast coast, West coast, down South, Midwest\nNowadays everybody knows how to get fresh\nSomebody give me a big yes\nGod bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)\nNow I'm too fucked up to dance\nSo I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants\nYou can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance\nSo go pry open that trunk and get those amps\n\nIn the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester\nTreat me like a God or they treat me like a leper\nYou see me move back and forth between both\nI'm trying to find a balance\nI'm trying to build a balance\n\nSo now I keep a close eye on my pets\nBecause they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents\nIt's eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense\nSo straight you can set your clocks and place bets\nWait, let's prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead\nHustle, maybe a couple will love what you said\nEmcees drag their feet across a big naked land\nWith an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand\nYeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll\nStop writing raps and go play volleyball\nGotta journey the world in a hurry\nCause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury\nGuilty of dropping these bombs in the city\nBut I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em\nGuilty of setting my fire in all fifty\nBut I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium\n\nIn the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester\nTreat me like a God or they treat me like a leper\nYou see me move back and forth between both\nI'm trying to find a balance\nI'm trying to build a balance\n\nNow all my friends are famous\nIt's either one thing or another\nThey all don't know what my name is\nProbably know both of my brothers\nThe one is a hard workin' savior\nThe other's a hard workin' soldier\nI'm just your next-door neighbor\nWorking hard at tryin' to stay sober\nYou wait for the car at the corner\nPretend like you know what the plot is\nWon't quit till I hit California\nAnd make you my Golden State goddess",

I got stuck\nThey can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck\nUsed to walk with luck, used to hold her hand\nFell behind and played the role of a slower man\nI want to stand on top of this mountain and yell\nI want to wake up and break up this lake of hell\nI feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up\nThe last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up\nOn a pick it up mission, kept it bitter\nGettin' in a million memories just to forget her\nThe difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled\nCookies for the road, took me by the soul\nHunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture\nGonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder\nInterpret the eyes, read the lines on her face\nThe sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?\nFuck you, Lucy, for leaving me\nFuck you, Lucy, for not needing me\nI wanna say fuck you because I still love you\nNo, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do\n\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n\nDo I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed\nEvery action has a point, five points make a fist\nYou close em', you swing em', it's hurts when it hits\nAnd the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits\nI got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning\nThat's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left\nAnd save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning\nI wanna scream, \"Fuck you, Lucy\"\nBut the problem is I love you, Lucy\nSo instead I'ma finish my drink and have another\nWhile you think about how you used to be my lover\n\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n\nIt - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if",

   "lyrics": "The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6\nShe left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks\nSexy little bitch, shorter than expected\nAbout 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs\nBeautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare\nLarge lips, soft hands, and long hair\nI said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it\nI'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it\n\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\n\nWho cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit\nI'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit\nLittle sister needs seclusion some how she'll discover it through the pop music\nGot used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following\nBouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering\nRiding the outer ring of your own private saturn\nThoughts scattered all across the grey matter\nLittle baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll\nThe patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall\nBreak it all smash the past like it was made of glass\nAin't no other way to make it last\nIt hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream\nI've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream\nAnd when she calms down I'll turn the sound down\nAnd put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that\n\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\n\nHush little lady don't say a word\nOr the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed\nAnd if you let them know that you're vulnerable\nThen there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)\nI'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook\nMistook love at first sight for a sex look\nEnough of the blind man's bluff\nI want the good stuff\nTrying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub\nThe modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle\nFeed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)\nBundle up in my mitten and coat\nAs cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat\nSo let the snow fall (it's coming down)\nShe doesn't want to understand why I still come around\nShe looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see\nShe holds no history of how precious she be\nLay your head on my chest, speak of the stress\nKick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest\nI hate to see you upset, it cramps the position\nAnd if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)\n\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle",

   "lyrics": "To all my killers and my hundred dollar billers\nTo emo kids that got too many feelings\nHe held the register open while he counted her change\nI was next in line which meant I was invisible\nFrom where I stood I could see that the till was full\nHe didn't look the type to play superhero\nSo I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes\nCrept out the store's front door to chase a little breath\nBangles in my head, shake the song off\nAnother manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk\nA car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass\nA woman and a child climbed out and left it running\nThey went inside of the deli, placed an order\nWith the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky\nWhen they came out mommy gave me a glance\nThat said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance\nAlready knew the deal, I lit one up and walked\nSo they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off\nThug love on the corner by the Walgreens\nLooking at me like I'm just another square Saltine\nAs I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches\nOut of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots\nI walk past with a nod and a reminisce\nSwear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis\nRespect the life and the fashions of the children\nIt's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building\nAll of a sudden I'm in front of some man\nNo, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand\nHe looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid\nImmediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say\n\"Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise\nI found it on my block in between a couple garages\nDidn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over\nI don't even know how to hold it\"\nIt was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete\nHeld it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected\nWedged it behind my belt buckle\nKnowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble\nThe extra strength felt weak\nBut over there on the corner saw what I needed\nAnd proceeded to cross the street\nPut the heat in the mail box to lose it\nFigured that the post office knows what's best to do with it\nMosey down the road, thinking about the old\nI used to roam this zone through two feet of snow\nRight here, this used to be a record shop\nI've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot\nI've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades\nThese alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days\nBefore I was a germ learning how to misbehave\nAll the way to the grave, south side is my resting place\nTook a right on Lyndale I'm getting near\nBut then the road became empty and the people disappeared\nThe clouds ran away, opened up the sky\nAnd one by one I watched every constellation die\nAnd there I was frozen, standing in my backyard\nFace to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star\nI should've known, walked all the way home\nTo find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone\nNo matter where I am, no matter what I do\nI'm always coming back home to you\nThey can leave me for dead they can take away my true\nI'm always coming back home to you\nThrough the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nAs sure as the life in the garden that you grew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nNo matter where I am, no matter what I do\nI'm always coming back home to you\nIf only I had known what you already knew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nFrom the heaven I've had to the hell I been through\nI'm always coming back home to you\nI'm always coming back home to you",

   "lyrics": "It's no surprise I overslept\nPut my boots on and climbed out my tent\nI didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping\nImmediately start a fire cause it's freezing\nI can't believe we went camping in the cold\nI'm in the wilderness standing in some snow\nA late start, but we can still catch up\nYou need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up\n\nThat's when I noticed your foot prints\nThe snow's fresh and those have been put since\nWhat, you're already up making the rounds?\nSo where you at now, you laid back down?\nThe breeze came and it stalled out the flame\nWhile I went to your tent and called out your name\nYou didn't answer, so I opened up the flap\nIt's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack\n\nI'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps\nAround the campground and hoofed down the path\nI figure you'll return, no concern\nI'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn\nThe wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on\nIt's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone\n\nIt ain't right, start the paranoia\nI left the camp site to go and search for ya\nI read the trail your feet made\nEach step was deliberately placed\nIt looks like you know where it leads\nBut I see nothing but leafless frozen trees\nAbout a quarter mile into the course\nAnother set of tracks appeared next to yours\nFrom the north it came out of the thick woods\nAnd those footprints belong to a big wolf\n\nTrying to find service on my cellphone\nI felt aight with my knife on my belt, though\nI hope the wolf is intimidated by you\nI wondered if you even knew what was behind you\nStalking ya, maybe watching ya\nWaiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya\nSalivating', wanna take ya to the stomach\nIn the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick\n\nAnd it gets about as bad it goes\nCause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow\nI understood, it doesn't look good\nYour fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf\nAnd the odds are in favor of the home team\nWhy'd you walk off all alone, where you going?\nIt ain't the right time to complain, but\nIt feels like I'm trying to find your remains\n\nYour foot prints grew further apart\nI knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart\nIt means you started to run, so I did the same\nNow my breaths looking like a steam engine train\nSuddenly your tracks dip off of the path\nAnd so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed\nInto the forest, expect the worst\nAdrenaline burst disturbed the nerves\n\n50 yards into the woods and brush\nIt got so thick that it looked like dusk\nThe air stood serene, sober\nIt seemed like a good 15 degrees colder\nAnd I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear\nThe sound of my heart beat was all I could hear\nLooking at the snow it was plain and clear\nThere was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared\n\nI can't process, I don't follow\nIt would be easier to believe that you were swallowed\nWith no sign of death, no sign of struggle\nNo signs of blood, no signs of trouble\nAnd the wolves never stopped\nThe tracks kept going and I took off\nSo I don't know how your story ends\nBut I know I'll never go into those woods again\n\nIt's not that tragic, it's not a shame\nYou're not the hunted, you're not the aim\nYou just another dog with hunger pains\nI was so afraid that you'd become the game\nI forgot to worry about what you became\nYou're not the hunted, you're not the aim\nYou just another dog with hunger pains\nI was so afraid that you'd become the game\nI forgot to worry about what you became",

   "lyrics": "Camera thief\nTake pictures\nRun like the parallel stitches\nAttach my feet to the path I beat\nTeach myself to keep the answers brief\nGnash my teeth like the last to feast\nImagine me on that abandoned beach\nSand and sea as if the jazz was free\nI\u2019m Ice cream mixed with gasoline\nDirect attention to the craftsmanship\nNeglect to mention that the past will stick\nLike initials carved in the concrete\nLike the tattoo that hides on your mommy\nI still kick it with angels\nThe difference is instead of the bar, I\u2019m at my kitchen table\nThe starlight shines through the glass\nBut you feel safe underneath that mask\n\nFerris Wheel, give rides\nThe scars healed in time to get high\nLock the doors and hide the keys\nLet's go describe how to climb a tree\nDon\u2019t sign the lease just cop a corner\nFor you to curl up and try to sleep\nThose cheap police won't find my wings\nI keep my dreams inside my dreams\nAnd If I had a time machine\nI\u2019d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean\nIt kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial\nNow give me all the cash out the drawer\nTouch that mustache down on the floor\nAnd I\u2019ll be in court holding a pitchfork\n'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport\n\nPocket watch, impatient\nFind a mate then make the migration\nBreak the rules, but first break the rulers\nAnd keep it moving like a rumor\nI don\u2019t need to defend my defensiveness\nI keep to myself, my family, and friendships\nI\u2019ve got enough people I could disappoint\nIf you disagree I think you missed the point\nNow go ahead and grab a chair\nLet me tell you about the last few years\nPulled out a sack full of Samson\u2019s hair\nAnd put it on the dash like a dancin\u2019 bear\nI wrote you a horoscope\nIt won't fit on this post-it note\nBut if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote\nIt goes fuck it, you might as well row that boat",

   "lyrics": "Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights\nTo place you dangerously close to that sun\nEnough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore\nAnd recognize the cause of what's done is done\nMore than enough to put my name behind my ideals\nAnd neglect my logic twice daily\nEnough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems\nWhen I remember how you used to call me baby\nEnough to look in my mirror with detest\nFor every tear you shed regardless of why you wept\nEnough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth\nOf the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath\n\nI love you, don't ever fucking question that\nThat's why we'll probably never get along\nIf I was better at finding the right words to say\nI wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs\nI love you, I love you (faded)\nNever, don't ever fucking question that\nDon't ever fucking question that\n\nRiding the public transit, I study the blank stares\nTo answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs\nI take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord\nAnd I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord\nSingle file lines, to give her a pound one at a time\nBut when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine\nI awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me\nTo submission and I still walk with my religion\nI watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror\nWorrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer\nI hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin\nGassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within\nFor every eclipse that stares at me\nFrom the other side of a paper cup of espresso\nI light a match beneath a kettle\nAnd for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program\nTo seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip\nI know a man who met a woman, don't remember where\nBig beautiful eyes and light brown hair\nShe was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city\nThis was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty\nTwo different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town\nWe all know how people like to get down\nHere we go, Aquarius, Pisces\nFeel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul\nPush shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain\nThe magic from up above what it does for the brain\nMake the love, paint the picture, write the song\nThe player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean\nMake the love, paint the picture, write the song\nThe player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean\nMake the love, paint the picture, and write that song\nTill the break of dawn\n\nI love you, don't ever fucking question that\nThat's why we'll probably never get along\nIf I was better at finding the right words to say\nI wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs",

    "plain": "The song addresses the failure of society, as a whole, both individuals and the masses (i.e. CNN, Fox, the news..) to accept blame for the pitfalls of our society. Instead of trying to identify and fix our issues, we instead try to blame everything under the sun for our shortcomings.\n\nThis song is from the debut album of Atmosphere named \u201cOvercast!\u201d\n\nWhile \u2018God\u2019s Bathroom Floor\u2019 was our local breakout song, this was the song that was our national breakout to the rap underground. While it did get us booked on mix shows across the country, I felt it was almost a 'cheating\u2019 style of writing. I use the word \u2018It\u2019s\u2019 over 50 times. That\u2019s the hook. It\u2019s cheating. Sometimes when we do a song a lot I feel the need to put it on hiatus, but this song did recently return to our live shows.\n\n\nSlug, from an interview with Complex\n\n\n\nThe song sampled The Bee Gees' \u201cWalking Back to Waterloo and KRS-One\u2019s Necessary"

Probably so\nI found your tape in my old collection\nPut it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one\nI look back with a hesitant laugh\nBut in reality it\u2019s dark down memory ave\nAll the trials and suffering we shared with each other\nA lot of people thought that we were actually brothers\nYou know me, you know I\u2019m a control freak\nWho told you, you could die before me?\nGone, another dog lost to the wild\nI feel like a snot-nosed child\nAnd when I hear your Smile\nIts outlined in sadness\nYou poked holes in the magic\nYou taught jokes to the clowns\nThat never learned how\nTo appreciate the lights\nBefore the bulbs burned out\nFlicker\n\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\n\nYeah, I been thinking, You already know\nDo I sound frustrated? Probably so\nSometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road\nIf I\u2019da seen where it was going I\u2019da stopped the whole show\nI realize it ain\u2019t realistic\nI keep tryna make the pieces fit with\nThe info presented\nI felt resentment\nI held this against myself\nI wanna help my friend\nIt stays in my head\nThat I was on a stage when you were laying in bed\nBody was discovered by your own mother\nIt penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret\nThat I slept through a late night call from your homie\nBut then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning\nAnd then I smoked one million cigarettes\nGo figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya\nFlicker\n\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\n\nYeah I been sinkin\u2019, you already know\nDo I look exhausted? Probably so\nI don\u2019t get much sleep\nI\u2019m not sick, I\u2019m fine\nI\u2019m just tryna make the most of this limited time\nAnd I\u2019m missing you but I ain\u2019t gonna lie\nThe distance grew between Eye and I\nAnd at the end, even though we didn\u2019t speak enough\nYou were easily one of the best people I\u2019ve loved\nNow I\u2019m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter\nThat wrote they own songs about life and death\nAnd every breath is full of self-awareness\nDon\u2019t ever be afraid to be embarrassed\nSo I wrote these words to describe what I cry about\nBut I\u2019m certain if you were here right now\nYou\u2019d ridicule these lyrics, you\u2019d hate this chorus\nYou\u2019d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward\nFlicker\n\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark",

   "lyrics": "Dear Jacob\nI won't take up too much of you time\nI know you're trying to get your video game-grind on\nAnd that's fine\nJust gimme a second to empty my face\nBefore I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase\nI've been watching you and\nI'm proud of you man\nYou're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can\nI know you understand\nWhy I go out of town\nI also know my days are colder when you're not around\nSometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact\nThat daddy never lived inside the same shack\nAnd sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit\nIt's what I get\nI'm convinced it's my punishment\nFor those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar\nIn some city with some people I don't know\nFor all the times that the lines on your face\nReminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped\nIt trips me out how you pick up all my traits\nFrom the way that you spit to the fists that you make\nI watch the way you try to keep your mom happy\nDaddy learned that from you\nYou're supposed to learn that from daddy\nI can't teach much when it comes to women\nI drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine\nYou're doing good little man that's all I really meant\nI love you\nYou're my best friend, thanks for listening\n\nDear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?\nYeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old\nSorry that the phone calls ain't too routine\nJust been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing\nSometimes the weeks fly a little too fast\nAnd sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed\nOther times I'm not sittin' on enough cash\nAnd other times today feels too much like the past\nSometimes at night I would watch y'all fight\nA child wonderin'\nWhy your life just ain't alright?\nWhat's the violence about? Why's it in my house?\nAnd even the memories are turned up too loud\nYeah, I got some issues in my head\nKnew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you\nI'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now\nBut your little man just wants you to listen now\nI'm over 30, can't maintain relations\nAll these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience\nI can't trust them, and they're not much help\nWhen they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself\nWhat pride, fists, and words just might do?\nI'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you\nI've never hit a woman\nI won't do coke\nAnd for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man\n\nDear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say\nJust checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today\nI know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises\nHow's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?\nGot a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders\nSo you let your paranoia place your bets for you\nToo many cigarettes, messing up your voice\nToo many arguments, trying to test your poise\nThe only women that love you are fans and family\nMom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly\nNo heavy rotation in any location\nYou're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation\nPlus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted\nStop it, everybody knows that you've lost it\nSinging for these kids you don't know\nWhen you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone\nFighting with your girl like it's you against the world\nAnother drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus\nCome and save him Jesus\nPlace him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas\nSometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done\nAnd love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone\nYour son says, \"Hi dad\", your dad says, \"What's up?\"\nAnd me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, \"Good luck.\"",

    "plain": "From \u201cWhen Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold\u201d\n\nThis song tells the story of a man who visits the same coffee shop everyday. He is homeless, so it is a place for him to stay, but he actually wants to see a woman that works there. She constantly tells him to leave, he still goes back because he loves her.\nThe song initially makes it sound as if the man is in love with the woman he doesn\u2019t really know, but the last line reveals a possibilty she\u2019s his own daughter.\n\nTom Waits provides the beat box effect for this song."

   "lyrics": "A city full of people and my favorite is that waitress\nAnd she treats me like some type of common vagrant\nI see her every day, but there's nothing to say\nUnless I decide to step inside of that cafe\nI only get to sit if I buy something to eat\nOtherwise it's best to keep my feet moving down that street\nAnd god damn she's a hard bitch\nTalks at me like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage\nYeah I know that the toilet is for customers\nYou ain't got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work\nIt doesn't have to be a game of patty cake\nBut it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway\nAnd by the way, I can see it in your eyes\nYou're angry with your life, not a stranger to the fight\nI bet you hate every man that you date\nAnd you're probably addicted to all types of escape\nYou take it out on me that you're all alone\nWhen you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones\nWatch the tone when you speak to old folks\nI'm grown, just trying to get out of this Minnesota cold\n\nLook lady, I'm homeless, I'm crazy\nI'm so hopeless I'm suicidal daily\nIf you and I can't co-exist, let's fake it\n'Cause I ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship\n\nI'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me\nAnd transport me to the ever after happily\nMaybe reincarnated with luck\nCome back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup\nShe said she's had it up to here\nShe's gonna call authorities if I don't disappear\nI love her threats, it rejuvenates my breath\nI give her stress for the reaction that it gets\nI got a pocket full of panhandled money\nOn a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun\nIn front of everyone she calls me bum\nBut she notices my absence on them afternoons I don't come\nSo here I am, thorn in her hip\nHolding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips\nIgnoring the insults and evil eyes\nI feed off of 'em, I wonder when she'll realize\nThat she's the only reason I visit\nThe only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence\nAnd if my ship ever comes, I'll miss it\nBecause I'm getting old and I ain't got much left to give it\nSo there it is and I have to live with it\nI had the chance to make a difference, but I didn't\nIn the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water\nThinking: \"Damn, I should've been a better father to my daughter\"",

He is homeless, so it is a place for him to stay, but he actually wants to see a woman that works there. She constantly tells him to leave, he still goes back because he loves her.\nThe song initially makes it sound as if the man is in love with the woman he doesn\u2019t really know, but the last line reveals a possibilty she\u2019s his own daughter.\n\nTom Waits provides the beat box effect for this song."

 "description": {
  "plain": "Hailing from the frozen tundra of Minnesota, better known for its pop idols and drunk rockers, Atmosphere is a rap duo who \u201cput Minneapolis Hip Hop on the map\u201d.\n\nOriginally, a collective of Minnesota rappers and beatmakers known as Headshots made mixtapes of their music that they gave away for free. By 1997, the collective had been reduced to Sean \u201cSlug\u201d Daley,  Brent \u201cSiddiq\u201d Sayers, Anthony \u201cAnt\u201d Davis, Derek \u201cSpawn\u201d Turner and Musab \u201cBeyond\u201d Saad who began to focus on the \u201cimportant shit\u201d necessary to creating a successful music business. Siddiq stopped making beats to focus on managing Rhymesayers Entertainment (RSE) \u2013  a company that would eventually become \u201cthe Twin Cities' biggest record label\u201d.\n\nTouring anywhere for anyone for any price combined connecting with fans using an early presence on the Internet allowed Atmosphere, at the time a trio of Slug, Spawn & Ant, to grow a following without radio play, MTV exposure or having their albums in stores. Spawn left the group for personal reasons around the time Atmosphere\u2019s first album Overcast was released.\n\nOver the next five years, Atmosphere collaborated with Dynospectrum and Deep Puddle Dynamics, and released several of their own EPs along with the cassette-only Headshots: Se7en.

Next, The Family Sign, Southsiders and Fishing Blues offered more of the group\u2019s introspective lyrics over further efforts to give hip hop a more mature sound. All three albums (and the preceding double EP) reached the top 40 on Billboard\u2019s Albums Chart. 2018\u2019s Mi Vida Local did not achieve the same level of chart success the duo had experienced over the previous ten years."

     "plain": "Hailing from the frozen tundra of Minnesota, better known for its pop idols and drunk rockers, Atmosphere is a rap duo who \u201cput Minneapolis Hip Hop on the map\u201d.\n\nOriginally, a collective of Minnesota rappers and beatmakers known as Headshots made mixtapes of their music that they gave away for free. By 1997, the collective had been reduced to Sean \u201cSlug\u201d Daley,  Brent \u201cSiddiq\u201d Sayers, Anthony \u201cAnt\u201d Davis, Derek \u201cSpawn\u201d Turner and Musab \u201cBeyond\u201d Saad who began to focus on the \u201cimportant shit\u201d necessary to creating a successful music business. Siddiq stopped making beats to focus on managing Rhymesayers Entertainment (RSE) \u2013  a company that would eventually become \u201cthe Twin Cities' biggest record label\u201d.\n\nTouring anywhere for anyone for any price combined connecting with fans using an early presence on the Internet allowed Atmosphere, at the time a trio of Slug, Spawn & Ant, to grow a following without radio play, MTV exposure or having their albums in stores. Spawn left the group for personal reasons around the time Atmosphere\u2019s first album Overcast was released.\n\nOver the next five years, Atmosphere collaborated with Dynospectrum and Deep Puddle Dynamics, and released several of their own EPs along with the cassette-only Headshots: Se7en. In 2002, Atmosphere dropped GodLovesUgly and it sold 13,000 copies in its first week, leading to a number of major labels (unsuccessfully) courting the duo. It appeared on the Billboard 200 and its single \u201cModern Man\u2019s Hustle\u201d remains Atmosphere\u2019s only top 20 on Billboard\u2019s Rap Chart.\n\nThree months before the band released Seven\u2019s Travels, a 16-year old female fan was raped and murdered by a recently paroled janitor who worked at the venue where Atmosphere was performing \u2013 an event that would not only inspire a change of cover art for the album, but also a change in Slug who would \u201ctransition to try to be a more responsible artist not just to the audience but to myself\u201d.
